## 1. Problem Areas Identified

### 1.1 Regulatory Interpretation Challenges

**Areas Needing Clarification:**
- TSI interpretation boundaries (trade/commerce vs. company operations)
- Critical asset scope determination (network segmentation limits)
- Foreign-located systems assessment criteria
- Multi-site coordination requirements
- Vendor system criticality assessment

**Status**: Documented in research, but may benefit from Coast Guard guidance or industry consensus

### 1.2 Implementation Challenges

**Common Challenges:**
- Balancing corporate framework with site-specific needs
- Managing cloud/SaaS systems as critical assets
- Coordinating across multiple facilities
- Resource constraints for small facilities
- Integration with existing security programs

**Status**: Addressed in research documents, but may need more specific guidance

### 1.3 Documentation Challenges

**Documentation Issues:**
- Determining appropriate level of detail
- Balancing completeness with usability
- Managing documentation updates
- Organizing for Coast Guard review
- Maintaining consistency across sites

**Status**: Templates created, but may need refinement based on feedback

## 2. Research Gaps

### 2.1 Quantitative Data Gaps

**Missing Data:**
- Actual cost data from facilities (anonymized)
- Implementation timeline data from real projects
- Common gap patterns from actual assessments
- Training effectiveness metrics
- Incident frequency and types

**Impact**: Cost estimates and timelines are illustrative rather than data-driven

**Future Research**: Collect anonymized data from facilities implementing MTSA compliance

### 2.2 Industry-Specific Gaps

**Industry-Specific Needs:**
- Chemical industry specific considerations
- Refining/petrochemical specific requirements
- Port terminal specific considerations
- Intermodal facility considerations

**Status**: Identified as P3 research item (Industry-Specific Considerations)

### 2.3 Advanced Topic Gaps

**Advanced Topics:**
- AI/ML in cybersecurity for MTSA
- Zero-trust architecture for maritime
- Advanced threat detection
- Predictive compliance analytics

**Status**: Identified as P3 research item (Advanced Topics)

## 3. Unanswered Questions

### 3.1 Regulatory Questions

**Questions Requiring Coast Guard Clarification:**
- Specific District Office procedures and expectations
- Plan review timelines and approval criteria
- Inspection frequency and focus areas
- Enforcement actions and penalties
- Resubmission procedures and timelines

**Status**: Documented in Coast Guard Engagement Guide, but may need District-specific clarification

### 3.2 Technical Questions

**Technical Questions:**
- Specific network segmentation requirements
- OT/ICS security tool requirements
- Cloud service assessment methodologies
- Integration with existing systems requirements

**Status**: Addressed in research, but may need more specific technical guidance

### 3.3 Process Questions

**Process Questions:**
- Optimal implementation sequencing
- Resource allocation strategies
- Training delivery methods
- Assessment frequency and scope

**Status**: Addressed in research, but may benefit from industry best practices
