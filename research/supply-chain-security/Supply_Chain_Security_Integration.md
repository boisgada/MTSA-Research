## Important Notes

⚠️ **Supply chain security is an integral part of MTSA compliance.**

⚠️ **Vendor systems that are critical assets must be assessed and managed appropriately.**

⚠️ **Supply chain incidents may require NRC reporting if they could lead to TSI.**

⚠️ **Clear contracts and ongoing coordination are essential for supply chain security.**
