## 2. Supply Chain Risk Assessment

### 2.1 Risk Assessment Framework

**Assessment Components:**
1. Identify supply chain partners
2. Assess dependency levels
3. Evaluate security posture
4. Assess TSI potential
5. Prioritize risks
6. Develop mitigation strategies

### 2.2 Dependency Assessment

**Dependency Questions:**
- Which supply chain partners are critical?
- What systems do they access?
- What data do they handle?
- What operations do they support?
- What is the impact of disruption?

### 2.3 Security Posture Assessment

**Assessment Areas:**
- Vendor security controls
- Vendor compliance capabilities

### 2.4 TSI Potential Assessment

**TSI Assessment:**
- Could supply chain compromise lead to TSI?
- Does supply chain affect trade/commerce?
- Could supply chain disruption affect maritime operations?
- What is the regional economic impact?

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Supply chain security is an integral part of MTSA compliance.**

⚠️ **Vendor systems that are critical assets must be assessed and managed appropriately.**

⚠️ **Supply chain incidents may require NRC reporting if they could lead to TSI.**

⚠️ **Clear contracts and ongoing coordination are essential for supply chain security.**
