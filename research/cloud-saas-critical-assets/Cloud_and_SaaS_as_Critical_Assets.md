## 1. Cloud/SaaS Critical Asset Overview

### 1.1 Why Cloud/SaaS Assessment Matters

**Key Considerations:**
- Many organizations rely heavily on cloud/SaaS for critical operations
- Enterprise-wide standardized services support multiple facilities
- Cloud/SaaS systems may be critical assets if they affect trade/commerce
- Classification has significant compliance ramifications
- Assessment is complex due to shared responsibility models

### 1.2 Cloud Service Models

**Service Models:**
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Virtualized infrastructure
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Development and deployment platforms
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Complete software applications
- **Managed Services**: Outsourced management of systems

### 1.3 Common Cloud/SaaS Systems

**Enterprise Systems:**
- ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics)
- Logistics and supply chain systems
- Warehouse management systems
- Transportation management systems
- Customer relationship management (CRM)
- Collaboration platforms
- Email and communication systems
- Data analytics platforms

---

## 2. Assessment Criteria for Cloud/SaaS Criticality

### 2.1 TSI Impact Assessment

**Primary Assessment Question:**
- Could compromise of this cloud/SaaS system lead to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI)?

**TSI Impact Factors:**
- Transportation system disruption potential
- Regional economic disruption potential
- Trade/commerce impact
- Maritime operations impact
- Port operations impact
- Vessel traffic impact

### 2.2 Operational Impact Assessment

**Impact Questions:**
- Is this system required for maritime operations?
- Does system failure affect shipping operations?
- Does system affect cargo handling?
- Does system affect vessel scheduling?
- Does system affect port operations?

### 2.3 Trade/Commerce Impact Assessment

**Commerce Impact Questions:**
- Does system affect multiple entities (not just your organization)?
- Could system failure disrupt regional commerce?
- Does system affect supply chain operations?
- Does system affect port-wide operations?
- Does system affect intermodal operations?

### 2.4 Assessment Framework

**Assessment Process:**
1. Identify cloud/SaaS systems
2. Assess operational role
3. Evaluate TSI potential
4. Assess trade/commerce impact
5. Determine criticality
6. Document assessment

**Criticality Decision:**
- **Critical**: System affects trade/commerce, could lead to TSI
- **Non-Critical**: System only affects company operations, no TSI potential
