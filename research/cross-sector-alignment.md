## How to Reuse Quickly

1) Pull templates: CFATS-style security plans (ACC), AWWA risk/resilience assessments, NERC CIP evidence checklists, APTA drill/incident workflows.
2) Map controls: Borrow OT segmentation, incident response, and reporting models; keep MTSA citations primary.
3) Cite sources: Add URLs/dates in `VERIFIED_REFERENCES.md` under “Cross-Sector Best Practices.”
4) Engage: Join/observe webinars and working groups (ACC, AWWA, NERC, API, APTA, SIA) to track updates with minimal lift.

## Notes

- Use these as best-practice analogs; regulatory primacy remains MTSA (33 CFR, NVIC).
- Flag any reuse that requires Coast Guard confirmation before implementation.
