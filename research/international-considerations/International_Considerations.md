## 1. International Considerations Overview

### 1.1 International Scope

**Key Considerations:**
- Foreign-located systems may be critical assets
- International data transfers may be involved
- Cross-border coordination required
- Multiple regulatory frameworks
- Global operations complexity

### 1.2 MTSA Focus

**MTSA Principle:**
- Focus on impact on U.S. maritime operations
- Location does not determine criticality
- TSI impact is the determining factor
- U.S. facility compliance is primary

### 1.3 Compliance Challenges

**Challenges:**
- Multiple jurisdictions
- Different regulatory frameworks
- Cross-border coordination
- Data transfer restrictions
- Assessment limitations

---

## 2. Foreign-Located Systems Compliance

### 2.1 Critical Asset Assessment

**Assessment Principle:**
- Location does not exclude from scope
- Assess based on TSI impact
- Evaluate operational dependencies
- Consider trade/commerce impact

### 2.2 Compliance Requirements

**Requirements:**
- Same compliance requirements apply
- Assessment challenges may be greater
- Documentation access may be limited
- Provider cooperation critical

### 2.3 Assessment Strategies

**Strategies:**
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Document interdependencies
- Assess security posture
- Develop contingency plans
- Consult with regulatory authorities

---

## 3. International Data Transfer Considerations

### 3.1 Data Transfer Requirements

**Considerations:**
- Data residency requirements
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions
- Data protection regulations
- Privacy requirements
- Security requirements

### 3.2 Compliance Strategies

**Strategies:**
- Understand applicable regulations
- Implement data protection measures
- Use secure transfer methods
- Document data flows
- Ensure compliance

---

## 4. Cross-Border Coordination

### 4.1 Coordination Requirements

**Requirements:**
- Coordinate with foreign entities
- Manage cross-border operations
- Coordinate incident response
- Share information appropriately
- Maintain compliance

### 4.2 Coordination Strategies

**Strategies:**
- Establish communication protocols
- Define responsibilities
- Coordinate assessments
- Share information securely
- Maintain relationships

---

## 5. International Regulatory Alignment

### 5.1 Regulatory Frameworks

**Frameworks:**
- MTSA (U.S.)
- IMO guidelines (international)
- National regulations
- Regional requirements
- Industry standards

### 5.2 Alignment Strategies

**Strategies:**
- Understand all applicable regulations
- Identify overlaps and differences
- Align where possible
- Manage differences
- Document approach

---

## 6. Best Practices

### 6.1 International Best Practices

**Best Practices:**

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Foreign-located systems can be critical assets if they affect U.S. maritime operations.**

⚠️ **Location does not determine criticality - assessment is based on impact.**

⚠️ **Understand and comply with all applicable international regulations.**
