## 1. Critical Asset Identification Mistakes

### 1.1 Mistake: Over-Inclusion (Scope Creep)

**The Problem:**
- Including too many assets as "critical"
- Treating all IT/OT systems as critical
- Failing to apply TSI criteria rigorously
- Including systems that only affect company operations

**Why It Happens:**
- Fear of missing something
- Lack of clear TSI understanding
- Overly conservative approach
- Confusion between business-critical and MTSA-critical

**Impact:**
- Unnecessary compliance burden
- Increased costs and effort
- Diluted focus on truly critical assets
- Difficulty maintaining compliance across too many systems

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Apply TSI criteria strictly: "Could compromise lead to TSI?"
- ✅ Focus on trade/commerce impact, not company profitability
- ✅ Use network segmentation to limit scope
- ✅ Document why assets are NOT critical
- ✅ Review and challenge each asset inclusion

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Including all ERP systems because they're "business critical"
- ✅ **Right**: Including ERP systems only if their compromise could disrupt maritime trade/commerce

---

### 1.2 Mistake: Under-Inclusion (Missing Critical Assets)

**The Problem:**
- Missing systems that are truly critical
- Failing to identify interdependencies
- Overlooking foreign-located systems
- Ignoring systems that affect multiple facilities

**Why It Happens:**
- Incomplete asset inventory
- Lack of understanding of system interdependencies
- Assuming foreign systems are out of scope
- Focus only on facility-level systems

**Impact:**
- Non-compliance with MTSA requirements
- Security gaps in critical systems
- Potential enforcement actions
- Increased risk of TSI

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Conduct comprehensive asset inventory
- ✅ Map system interdependencies
- ✅ Assess foreign-located systems by impact, not location
- ✅ Consider systems affecting multiple facilities
- ✅ Review with subject matter experts

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Excluding foreign-located logistics system because it's "not in the facility"
- ✅ **Right**: Including foreign-located system if its compromise could cause transportation system disruption

---

### 1.3 Mistake: Inconsistent Assessment Criteria

**The Problem:**
- Different criteria applied to similar assets
- Subjective assessments without clear methodology
- Inconsistent documentation of decisions
- No clear rationale for inclusion/exclusion

**Why It Happens:**
- Lack of standardized assessment methodology
- Multiple assessors using different approaches
- No clear documentation requirements
- Insufficient training on assessment criteria

**Impact:**
- Difficult to defend decisions to Coast Guard
- Potential inconsistencies in compliance
- Documentation gaps
- Review delays

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Develop standardized assessment methodology
- ✅ Use consistent criteria across all assessments
- ✅ Document rationale for all decisions
- ✅ Train all assessors on methodology
- ✅ Review assessments for consistency

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: One assessor includes system A, another excludes similar system B without clear rationale
- ✅ **Right**: Both systems assessed using same criteria, with documented rationale for each decision

---

### 1.4 Mistake: Ignoring Network Segmentation Opportunities

**The Problem:**
- Including all systems in a network segment
- Not leveraging segmentation to limit scope
- Failing to prove non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
- Treating entire network as critical

**Why It Happens:**
- Lack of understanding of segmentation benefits
- Overly conservative approach
- Difficulty proving isolation
- Insufficient network architecture knowledge

**Impact:**
- Unnecessary compliance burden
- Increased costs
- Missed efficiency opportunities
- Over-scoped critical assets

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Understand network segmentation benefits
- ✅ Map network architecture thoroughly
- ✅ Prove isolation of non-shipping systems
- ✅ Document segmentation strategy
- ✅ Use segmentation similar to TWIC physical isolation

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Including entire corporate network because it's "connected"
- ✅ **Right**: Proving non-shipping systems are isolated and don't affect trade/commerce, excluding them from scope

---

## 2. TSI Interpretation Errors

### 2.1 Mistake: Confusing Company Profitability with Economic Disruption

**The Problem:**
- Treating any company financial impact as "economic disruption"
- Failing to distinguish company operations from regional commerce
- Including systems that only affect company profitability
- Misinterpreting "economic disruption in a particular area"

**Why It Happens:**
- Natural tendency to focus on company impact
- Lack of clear regulatory guidance
- Confusion about TSI definition
- Insufficient research on TSI interpretation

**Impact:**
- Over-inclusion of assets
- Unnecessary compliance burden
- Misallocation of resources
- Potential Coast Guard challenges

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Understand TSI focuses on trade/commerce, not company profitability
- ✅ Assess regional economic impact, not company financial impact
- ✅ Distinguish between company operations and maritime trade/commerce
- ✅ Reference TSI interpretation research

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Including accounting system because its compromise would affect company profitability
- ✅ **Right**: Excluding accounting system unless its compromise could disrupt regional trade/commerce

---

### 2.2 Mistake: Misinterpreting "Transportation System Disruption"

**The Problem:**
- Treating any operational disruption as "transportation system disruption"
- Failing to distinguish facility operations from transportation system
- Including systems that only affect single facility
- Not understanding system-wide vs. facility-specific impacts

**Why It Happens:**
- Ambiguous regulatory language
- Lack of clear examples
- Focus on facility operations
- Insufficient understanding of transportation system scope

**Impact:**
- Over-inclusion of assets
- Unnecessary compliance requirements
- Resource misallocation

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Understand "transportation system" refers to maritime trade/commerce network
- ✅ Distinguish facility operations from transportation system
- ✅ Assess system-wide impacts, not just facility impacts
- ✅ Reference TSI interpretation guidance

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Including facility maintenance system because its failure would disrupt facility operations
- ✅ **Right**: Including facility maintenance system only if its failure could disrupt port operations or vessel traffic

---

### 2.3 Mistake: Ignoring Trade/Commerce Focus

**The Problem:**
- Focusing on company operations instead of trade/commerce
- Not considering impacts on multiple entities
- Failing to assess regional commerce effects
- Missing supply chain and port operation impacts

**Why It Happens:**
- Natural company-centric perspective
- Lack of trade/commerce analysis
- Insufficient understanding of maritime commerce
- Focus on internal operations

**Impact:**
- Incorrect critical asset identification
- Missing truly critical assets
- Over-inclusion of non-critical assets

**How to Avoid:**
- ✅ Always assess trade/commerce impact
- ✅ Consider effects on multiple entities
- ✅ Evaluate regional commerce impacts
- ✅ Analyze supply chain and port operations

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong**: Assessing system only for impact on company operations
- ✅ **Right**: Assessing system for impact on port operations, vessel traffic, cargo handling, and regional commerce
