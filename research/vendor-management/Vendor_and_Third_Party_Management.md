- Vendor systems must be assessed and managed appropriately

**Challenges:**
- Limited visibility into vendor security
- Shared responsibility models
- Contract limitations
- Vendor assessment complexity
- Ongoing monitoring requirements

### 1.2 Scope of Vendor Management

**Vendor Types:**
- Cloud service providers
- SaaS applications

- Systems integrated with critical infrastructure

---

## 2. Identifying Vendor Systems as Critical Assets

### 2.1 Assessment Criteria

**Is a Vendor System Critical?**

Apply the same TSI criteria:
- Could compromise lead to Transportation Security Incident?
- Does system affect trade/commerce?
- Does system affect maritime operations?
- Does system affect port operations or vessel traffic?

**Key Questions:**
1. What is the vendor system's role in maritime operations?
2. Could vendor system compromise cause transportation system disruption?
3. Does vendor system affect multiple entities or just your organization?
4. Is vendor system required for shipping operations?
5. Could vendor system failure affect regional commerce?

### 2.2 Common Vendor Systems That May Be Critical

**Logistics and ERP Systems:**
- Supply chain management systems
