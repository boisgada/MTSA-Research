## 1. Risk Assessment Overview

### 1.1 Risk Assessment Purpose

**Assessment Objectives:**
- Identify risks to critical assets
- Assess risk likelihood and impact
- Prioritize risks for treatment
- Support Cybersecurity Plan development
- Enable risk-based decision making

**MTSA Context:**
- Focus on risks leading to TSI
- Assess trade/commerce impact
- Consider transportation system disruption
- Evaluate regional economic impact

### 1.2 Risk Assessment Scope

**Assessment Scope:**
- All critical assets
- Cybersecurity threats
- Vulnerabilities
- System interdependencies
- Operational impacts

---

## 2. MTSA-Specific Risk Considerations

### 2.1 TSI-Focused Risk Assessment

**Risk Assessment Focus:**
- Risks that could lead to TSI
- Transportation system disruption risks
- Regional economic disruption risks
- Trade/commerce impact risks

**Risk Assessment Questions:**
- Could this risk lead to TSI?
- Does this risk affect trade/commerce?
- Could this risk cause transportation system disruption?
- What is the regional economic impact?

### 2.2 Critical Asset Risk Assessment

**Asset-Specific Risks:**
- Risks to each critical asset
- Asset-specific threats
- Asset-specific vulnerabilities
- Asset-specific impacts

**Interdependency Risks:**
- Cascading failure risks
- System interdependency risks
- Supply chain risks
- Integration risks

### 2.3 Operational Risk Assessment

**Operational Risks:**
- Maritime operations risks
- Port operations risks
- Vessel operations risks
- Cargo handling risks

---

## 3. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 3.1 Risk Assessment Process

**Assessment Steps:**
1. Identify critical assets
2. Identify threats
3. Identify vulnerabilities
4. Assess likelihood
5. Assess impact
6. Calculate risk
7. Prioritize risks
8. Develop treatment plans

### 3.2 Risk Assessment Framework

**Risk Formula:**
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact
```

**Likelihood Assessment:**
- Very High
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Very Low

**Impact Assessment:**
- Critical (TSI)
- High (Significant disruption)
- Medium (Moderate disruption)
- Low (Limited disruption)
- Very Low (Minimal disruption)

### 3.3 Risk Assessment Methodology

**Methodology Components:**
- Threat assessment
- Vulnerability assessment
- Impact assessment
- Likelihood assessment
- Risk calculation
- Risk prioritization

---

## 4. Integration with Existing Frameworks

### 4.1 Framework Integration

**Existing Frameworks:**
- ISO 27001 risk assessment
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Corporate risk frameworks
- Industry risk methodologies

**Integration Approach:**
- Extend existing methodologies
- Add MTSA-specific considerations
- Align risk criteria
- Maintain consistency

### 4.2 Risk Criteria Alignment

**Criteria Alignment:**
- Align likelihood scales
- Align impact scales
- Align risk levels
- Maintain consistency

---

## 5. Risk Prioritization

### 5.1 Prioritization Framework

**Prioritization Criteria:**
- Risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- TSI potential
- Business impact
- Resource requirements
- Timeline considerations

### 5.2 Risk Prioritization Matrix

**Priority Levels:**
- **Priority 1**: Critical risks with TSI potential
- **Priority 2**: High risks affecting operations
- **Priority 3**: Medium risks requiring attention
- **Priority 4**: Low risks for monitoring

---

## 6. Risk Treatment Strategies

### 6.1 Treatment Options

**Treatment Strategies:**
- Mitigate: Reduce likelihood or impact
- Accept: Accept risk with monitoring
- Transfer: Transfer risk (insurance, contracts)
- Avoid: Eliminate risk source

### 6.2 Treatment Planning

**Treatment Plans:**
- Treatment strategy
- Specific actions
- Responsibilities
- Timelines
- Resource requirements

---

## 7. Risk Assessment Templates

### 7.1 Risk Assessment Template

**Template Sections:**
- Asset information
- Threat identification
- Vulnerability identification
- Likelihood assessment
- Impact assessment
- Risk calculation
- Treatment plan

### 7.2 Risk Register Template

**Register Fields:**
- Risk ID
- Risk description
- Asset
- Threat
- Vulnerability
- Likelihood
- Impact
- Risk level
- Treatment
- Status

---

## 8. Best Practices

### 8.1 Risk Assessment Best Practices

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Use systematic methodology
- ✅ Assess all critical assets
- ✅ Consider interdependencies
- ✅ Document thoroughly
- ✅ Review regularly

**Prioritization:**
