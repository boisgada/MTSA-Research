# Asset Inventory Spreadsheets

## Purpose

This folder contains **templates and placeholders** for critical asset inventory spreadsheets. Actual facility-specific spreadsheets are excluded from the public repository for security and confidentiality reasons.

## Templates Available

### Critical Asset Inventory Template
- **File**: `CRITICAL_ASSET_INVENTORY_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Purpose**: Template structure for creating facility-specific critical asset inventory spreadsheets
- **Use**: Reference this template when developing your own Excel spreadsheet for critical asset assessment

---

## Why Templates Instead of Actual Spreadsheets?

1. **Security**: Actual asset inventories contain sensitive security information about facility systems
2. **Confidentiality**: Asset inventories may reveal system architecture and security postures
3. **Facility-Specific**: Each facility needs its own customized inventory based on its unique systems
4. **Compliance**: Asset inventories are facility-specific and should not be shared publicly

---

## How to Use

1. **Review Template**: Review `CRITICAL_ASSET_INVENTORY_TEMPLATE.md` to understand the required structure
2. **Create Your Spreadsheet**: Create a new Excel spreadsheet using the template structure
3. **Populate with Your Data**: Fill in your facility-specific asset information
4. **Store Securely**: Keep your actual spreadsheet in a secure, access-controlled location
5. **Update Regularly**: Update your inventory as systems change or new assessments are conducted
