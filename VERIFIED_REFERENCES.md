## Sources Requiring Coast Guard Confirmation

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Coast Guard Clarification

1. **Network Segmentation for Scope Limitation**
   - **Recommendation**: Use network segmentation to limit scope similar to TWIC isolation
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COAST GUARD CONFIRMATION**
   - **Rationale**: Based on logical parallel to physical isolation, but needs regulatory confirmation

2. **TSI "Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**
   - **Recommendation**: Focus on trade/commerce disruption, not company operations
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COAST GUARD CONFIRMATION**
   - **Rationale**: Research indicates trade/commerce focus, but regulatory interpretation should be confirmed

3. **"Particular Area" Geographic Scope**
   - **Recommendation**: "Particular area" refers to regional economy, not facility
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COAST GUARD CONFIRMATION**
   - **Rationale**: Research indicates regional focus, but should be confirmed

4. **Foreign System Assessment Approach**
   - **Recommendation**: Assess by trade/commerce impact, not location
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COAST GUARD CONFIRMATION**
   - **Rationale**: Research supports approach, but Coast Guard confirmation recommended
