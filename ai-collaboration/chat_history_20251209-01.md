# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

### U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-20

NVIC 01-20 provides guidelines for addressing cyber risks at MTSA-regulated facilities:

- **Facility Security Assessment (FSA)**: Must assess and document vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**
   - Regularly update asset inventory
   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

1. Impact on U.S. maritime operations
2. Potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI)

## For Your SAP Logistics System Specifically

Your SAP system can be a critical asset if:
- It is integral to managing logistics that affect U.S. maritime facilities
- A compromise could lead to transportation system disruption, mismanagement of hazardous materials, or safety incidents
- U.S. operations depend on it for critical functions

## What I've Added to the Documents

### Research Document (Section 9):
- Explanation that foreign location doesn't exclude systems from criticality
- Assessment criteria for foreign-located systems
- Regulatory perspective on geographic scope
- Recommendations for evaluating and managing foreign systems
- Key questions to ask when assessing foreign systems

### Checklist:
- New section on "Foreign-Located Systems" in the risk assessment phase
- Specific questions for evaluating cloud/SaaS/international systems
- Added logistics/ERP systems to the IT asset categories
- Updated red flags to include foreign-located systems

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Assess SAP's role: Evaluate how critical SAP is to your U.S. maritime operations
2. Document interdependencies: Map how SAP connects to facility operations
3. Evaluate TSI potential: Determine if a SAP compromise could lead to a TSI
4. Consult Coast Guard: Discuss your specific situation for clarification
5. Document in FSP: If critical, include SAP in your Facility Security Plan with appropriate security measures

The documents now include guidance on this scenario. Should I help you assess your SAP system's criticality or create a template for documenting foreign-located systems?

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

### U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-20

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**
   - Regularly update asset inventory
   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important**: This approach requires careful planning, implementation, validation, and documentation. Engage with the Coast Guard early to ensure your approach will be accepted.

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**
   - Regularly update asset inventory
   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

```

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important**: This approach requires careful planning, implementation, validation, and documentation. Engage with the Coast Guard early to ensure your approach will be accepted.

To get scope limitation accepted, you need to demonstrate:
- Demonstrable isolation
- Operational independence
- No critical dependencies
- Effective controls
- Comprehensive documentation

### Updated checklist

Added a "Cyber Scope Limitation Assessment" section to the checklist with specific questions for:
- Network architecture
- Operational independence
- Dependency analysis
- FSP documentation
- Coast Guard engagement

## Bottom line

You can limit cyber scope similar to physical isolation by:
1. Proving logical isolation (non-shipping systems cannot access shipping systems)
2. Proving operational independence (shipping can function without non-shipping systems)
3. Implementing effective controls (network segmentation, firewalls, monitoring)
4. Documenting everything in your FSP

The key is demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident, just as physical isolation proves non-shipping areas don't need TWIC access.

Important: Engage with the Coast Guard early to ensure your approach will be accepted, similar to how you worked with them on physical isolation.

The documents are updated with this guidance. Should I help you develop a specific network segmentation plan or create templates for documenting your isolation strategy?

**User**

let's continue to do research into publicly available information to improve our confidence in the approach.  as stated before, the transportation interruption component of the TSI is very confusing so the stance that segmentation can mitigate an interruption in the logistics system located in a different country doesn't align with the segmentation thought process... how can we better understand the conflict?

# Understanding the "Transportation System Disruption" Conflict

## The Core Conflict

You've identified a critical logical inconsistency:

1. **Network segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations at the facility level
2. **Foreign-located logistics systems** (like SAP) could cause "transportation system disruption" if compromised
3. **Facility-level segmentation** doesn't prevent disruption if the foreign system itself is compromised
4. **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

This document explores this conflict and seeks to clarify the interpretation of "transportation system disruption" in the TSI definition.

---

## TSI Definition Review

A **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, **transportation system disruption**, or economic disruption in a **particular area**."

### Key Questions for Interpretation

1. **What is "transportation system disruption"?**
   - Disruption of the facility's shipping operations?
   - Disruption of the broader maritime transportation network?
   - Disruption of regional/national transportation infrastructure?
   - Any disruption affecting transportation services?

2. **What is "particular area"?**
   - The facility itself?
   - The local port/maritime area?
   - A regional transportation network?
   - A geographic region?

3. **What is the "could lead to" standard?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways through cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway, no matter how remote?

---

## The Segmentation vs. Foreign System Conflict

### Scenario Analysis

#### Scenario 1: Facility-Level Segmentation
- **Setup**: Shipping operations network is isolated from general business network
- **Assumption**: Non-shipping systems cannot access shipping systems
- **Question**: Does this mean non-shipping systems are out of scope?

#### Scenario 2: Foreign-Located Critical System
- **Setup**: SAP logistics system is located in another country
- **Function**: Manages logistics, cargo tracking, vessel scheduling
- **Impact if Compromised**: Could disrupt shipping operations, causing transportation system disruption
- **Question**: Is SAP in scope even though it's foreign-located?

#### The Conflict
- If SAP can cause "transportation system disruption" (a TSI component), it's likely a critical asset
- Facility-level segmentation doesn't prevent SAP from being compromised
- Facility-level segmentation doesn't prevent SAP compromise from causing disruption
- **Therefore**: How does segmentation help limit scope if foreign systems are still in scope?

## Research Findings: "Transportation System Disruption"

### Regulatory Text Search

**33 CFR 101.105** defines TSI, but specific interpretation of "transportation system disruption" is not detailed in readily available public sources.

### Key Interpretive Questions

1. **Scope of "Transportation System"**
   - **Narrow Interpretation**: The facility's transportation operations only
   - **Broad Interpretation**: The broader maritime transportation network/port area
   - **Very Broad**: Regional or national transportation infrastructure

2. **Scope of "Disruption"**
   - **Minimal**: Any interruption of normal operations
   - **Moderate**: Significant operational impact
   - **Severe**: Complete shutdown or major failure

3. **Scope of "Particular Area"**
   - **Facility**: The MTSA-regulated facility itself
   - **Port Area**: The port/maritime area where the facility operates
   - **Regional**: A broader geographic region affected by the disruption

### Potential Interpretations

#### Interpretation A: Facility-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the facility's shipping operations
- "Particular area" = the facility or immediate port area
- **Implication**: If you can segment and prove non-shipping systems can't disrupt shipping operations, they may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system is required for shipping operations, it's in scope regardless of location

#### Interpretation B: Network-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the broader maritime transportation network
- "Particular area" = the port/maritime area or regional network
- **Implication**: Any system that could disrupt the broader network is in scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system could affect the broader network, it's in scope

#### Interpretation C: Impact-Based
- "Transportation system disruption" = any disruption that affects transportation services in a particular area
- "Particular area" = defined by the impact, not geography
- **Implication**: Focus on impact, not location or direct connection
- **Foreign Systems**: If impact could reach transportation services, it's in scope

---

## The "Could Lead To" Standard

### Critical Asset Definition

Critical assets are those **"whose compromise could lead to a TSI"**.

### Key Questions

1. **What does "could lead to" mean?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways?
   - Cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway?

2. **How remote can the pathway be?**
   - Must be direct and immediate?
   - Can include indirect dependencies?
   - Can include multiple steps?

3. **What is the burden of proof?**
   - Must prove it could happen?
   - Must prove it's likely?
   - Must prove there's no pathway?

### Potential Standards

#### Standard 1: Direct Causation
- Asset compromise must directly cause TSI
- No intermediate steps
- **Example**: Compromise of vessel traffic system directly causes collision

#### Standard 2: Reasonable Pathway
- Asset compromise must have a reasonable pathway to TSI
- Can include intermediate steps if logical
- **Example**: Compromise of logistics system → incorrect cargo manifests → safety incident

#### Standard 3: Any Potential Pathway
- Asset compromise must have any potential pathway to TSI, no matter how remote
- Includes theoretical possibilities
- **Example**: Any system that could theoretically affect operations

---

## Reconciling the Conflict: Potential Approaches

### Approach 1: Distinguish Between Direct and Indirect Support

**Concept**: Distinguish between systems that "directly support" shipping operations vs. those that "indirectly support" or "could theoretically affect" operations.

**Application**:
- **Direct Support**: Systems required for shipping operations to function
  - Vessel traffic management
  - Cargo handling systems
  - Loading/unloading controls
  - **Foreign Systems**: If SAP is required for shipping operations, it directly supports them
  
- **Indirect Support**: Systems that support business operations but aren't required for shipping
  - General business systems
  - HR systems
  - Finance systems (unless required for shipping)
  - **Segmentation**: If properly isolated, these may be out of scope

**Key Question**: Can you operate shipping without SAP? If no, SAP directly supports shipping and is in scope regardless of location.

### Approach 2: Focus on Operational Independence

**Concept**: If shipping operations can function independently of non-shipping systems, those systems may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
- **If Yes**: Non-shipping systems may be out of scope (with proper segmentation)
- **If No**: Non-shipping systems are in scope

**Foreign Systems**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if SAP fails?
- **If Yes**: SAP may not be critical (unlikely for logistics system)
- **If No**: SAP is critical and in scope

**Segmentation Role**: Segmentation helps prove operational independence by preventing non-shipping systems from affecting shipping systems.

### Approach 3: Distinguish Between System Location and System Function

**Concept**: The location of a system (foreign vs. domestic) is separate from whether it's critical. Segmentation addresses facility-level scope, not foreign system criticality.

**Application**:
- **Facility-Level Segmentation**: Limits scope of facility systems
  - Isolates shipping operations from non-shipping operations
  - Proves non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping
  
- **Foreign System Assessment**: Separate assessment of foreign systems
  - If foreign system is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of location
  - Segmentation doesn't change foreign system criticality
  - But segmentation may prevent foreign system compromise from affecting non-shipping facility systems

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are separate issues:
- Segmentation limits **facility-level** scope
- Foreign system criticality is determined by **operational dependency**, not location

### Approach 4: Focus on "Particular Area" Interpretation

**Concept**: If "particular area" means the facility or immediate port area, then systems that only affect broader operations may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Facility/Port Area Impact**: Systems that could disrupt facility/port operations are in scope
- **Broader Impact Only**: Systems that only affect broader operations (not facility/port) may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If SAP disruption only affects broader logistics (not facility operations), may be out of scope

**Challenge**: This interpretation may be too narrow and may not align with Coast Guard expectations.

## Recommended Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Assess Operational Dependency

For each system (facility or foreign):

1. **Is the system required for shipping operations to function?**
   - Yes → Likely critical
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Can shipping operations continue if this system fails?**
   - No → Likely critical
   - Yes → May not be critical

3. **What is the maximum acceptable downtime?**
   - Minutes/hours → Likely critical
   - Days/weeks → May not be critical

### Step 2: Assess TSI Pathway

For each system:

1. **Direct Pathway**: Can system compromise directly cause TSI?
   - Example: Vessel traffic system → collision
   - If yes → Critical

2. **Indirect Pathway**: Can system compromise lead to TSI through intermediate steps?
   - Example: Logistics system → incorrect cargo → safety incident
   - Assess reasonableness of pathway

3. **Cascading Failure**: Could system failure cascade to critical systems?
   - Assess interdependencies
   - Evaluate segmentation effectiveness

### Step 3: Assess Segmentation Effectiveness

For facility-level systems:

1. **Can segmentation prevent access to shipping systems?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

2. **Can segmentation prevent impact on shipping operations?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

3. **Is operational independence proven?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

### Step 4: Assess Foreign Systems Separately

For foreign-located systems:

1. **Operational Dependency**: Is system required for shipping?
   - Yes → Likely critical regardless of location
   - No → May not be critical

2. **TSI Pathway**: Can compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Yes → Critical
   - No → May not be critical

3. **Segmentation Role**: Can facility segmentation prevent foreign system from affecting non-shipping systems?
   - Yes → Segmentation helps limit scope of impact
   - No → Foreign system affects entire facility scope

---

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Insight 1: Segmentation and Foreign Systems Are Separate Issues

- **Segmentation** addresses facility-level scope limitation
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway
- Segmentation doesn't change whether a foreign system is critical
- But segmentation may limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise

### Insight 2: The "Transportation System Disruption" Question Needs Clarification

- The regulatory definition is not specific
- Interpretation may vary
- **Recommendation**: Engage with Coast Guard to clarify:
  - What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
  - What is the scope of "particular area"?
  - What is the "could lead to" standard?

### Insight 3: Operational Dependency Is Key

- If SAP is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

- The question is: **Can shipping operations function without SAP?**
  - If no → SAP is critical
  - If yes → SAP may not be critical

### Insight 4: Segmentation May Still Have Value

Even if foreign systems are critical, facility-level segmentation may:
- Limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise
- Prevent non-shipping systems from being affected
- Demonstrate operational independence of shipping operations
- Reduce overall risk surface

### Insight 5: The Conflict May Be Unresolvable Without Regulatory Clarification

The logical conflict you've identified suggests that:
- Either "transportation system disruption" has a narrower interpretation than assumed
- Or foreign systems that could cause disruption are in scope regardless of segmentation
- Or there's a distinction between "direct support" and "indirect support" that needs clarification

---

## Questions for Coast Guard Engagement

When engaging with the Coast Guard, consider asking:

1. **TSI Definition Clarification**
   - What specifically constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
   - What is the scope of "particular area"?
   - Are there examples or case studies of what constitutes a TSI?

2. **Critical Asset Scope**
   - What is the "could lead to" standard?
   - Must the pathway be direct, or can it be indirect?
   - How remote can the pathway be?

3. **Foreign Systems**
   - How are foreign-located systems assessed?
   - Does location affect criticality assessment?
   - How do foreign systems fit into facility security plans?

4. **Segmentation and Scope Limitation**
   - Can network segmentation limit the scope of critical assets?
   - What level of isolation is required?
   - How is operational independence demonstrated?

5. **Operational Dependency**
   - How is "required for operations" defined?
   - What is the threshold for operational dependency?
   - How is acceptable downtime determined?

---

## Conclusion

The conflict you've identified is real and important:

1. **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping from non-shipping operations
2. **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical
3. **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
4. **Therefore**: There's a logical inconsistency that needs resolution

**Potential Resolutions**:

1. **Narrow TSI Interpretation**: "Transportation system disruption" may have a narrower scope than assumed
2. **Operational Dependency Focus**: If SAP is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of segmentation
3. **Separate Assessments**: Segmentation limits facility scope; foreign systems assessed separately
4. **Regulatory Clarification Needed**: The conflict suggests need for Coast Guard guidance

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Engage Coast Guard**: Seek clarification on TSI definition and scope
2. **Assess Operational Dependency**: Determine if SAP is truly required for shipping
3. **Document Analysis**: Clearly document your assessment and reasoning
4. **Propose Approach**: Present your analysis and proposed scope limitation to Coast Guard
5. **Seek Approval**: Get Coast Guard acceptance of your approach before finalizing FSP

The key is to **acknowledge the conflict, analyze it thoroughly, and seek regulatory clarification** rather than assuming one interpretation over another.

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

### U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-20

NVIC 01-20 provides guidelines for addressing cyber risks at MTSA-regulated facilities:

- **Facility Security Assessment (FSA)**: Must assess and document vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks
- **Facility Security Plan (FSP)**: Must address identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Alternative Security Program (ASP)**: Can be used as an alternative to FSP

### Key Requirements

1. **Cybersecurity Plan**: Develop and maintain a cybersecurity plan addressing identified risks
2. **Regular Updates**: Update plans to adapt to evolving threats and regulatory changes
3. **Reporting**: Report breaches of security, suspicious activities, and cyber incidents to appropriate authorities (e.g., National Response Center)

---

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**
   - Regularly update asset inventory
   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

### Important Conflict: Segmentation vs. Foreign-Located Systems

**The Conflict**: There is a logical inconsistency that needs to be addressed:

- **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations
- **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP logistics) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical assets
- **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are **separate issues**:
- **Segmentation** limits facility-level scope (proving non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping)
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway, not location
- If a foreign system (like SAP) is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Its location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

**The Critical Question**: Can shipping operations function without the foreign system?
- **If No** → System is critical and in scope regardless of location or segmentation
- **If Yes** → System may not be critical

**"Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**: The regulatory definition of TSI includes "transportation system disruption" but the interpretation is not clearly specified. This creates uncertainty about:
- What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
- What is the scope of "particular area"?
- What is the "could lead to" standard?

**Recommendation**: See the detailed analysis in `TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md` for a comprehensive exploration of this conflict and potential approaches to resolution.

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important Limitations**:
- Facility-level segmentation addresses facility systems, not foreign-located systems
- Foreign systems are assessed separately based on operational dependency
- The "transportation system disruption" component of TSI needs clarification
- **Engage with Coast Guard** to clarify TSI interpretation and scope before finalizing approach

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework

   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

### Important Conflict: Segmentation vs. Foreign-Located Systems

**The Conflict**: There is a logical inconsistency that needs to be addressed:

- **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations
- **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP logistics) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical assets
- **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are **separate issues**:
- **Segmentation** limits facility-level scope (proving non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping)
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway, not location
- If a foreign system (like SAP) is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Its location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

**The Critical Question**: Can shipping operations function without the foreign system?
- **If No** → System is critical and in scope regardless of location or segmentation
- **If Yes** → System may not be critical

**"Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**: The regulatory definition of TSI includes "transportation system disruption" but the interpretation is not clearly specified. This creates uncertainty about:
- What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
- What is the scope of "particular area"?
- What is the "could lead to" standard?

**Recommendation**: See the detailed analysis in `TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md` for a comprehensive exploration of this conflict and potential approaches to resolution.

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important Limitations**:
- Facility-level segmentation addresses facility systems, not foreign-located systems
- Foreign systems are assessed separately based on operational dependency
- The "transportation system disruption" component of TSI needs clarification
- **Engage with Coast Guard** to clarify TSI interpretation and scope before finalizing approach

---

## 11. Conclusion

Defining critical assets under MTSA requires a systematic, risk-based approach that focuses on preventing Transportation Security Incidents. Key takeaways:

1. **Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a TSI
2. **TSI scope** is clearly defined: significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption
3. **Industry practices** emphasize structured classification and risk-based assessment
4. **Regulatory guidance** is available through NVIC 01-20 and Coast Guard resources
5. **Frameworks** like NIST and CISA tools can support the assessment process

By following a structured approach and leveraging available resources, chemical companies can effectively identify critical assets and ensure compliance with MTSA cybersecurity requirements.

Created an analysis document addressing the conflict. Summary:

## Created: TSI Transportation Disruption Analysis

A new document (`TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md`) that:

### 1. Acknowledges the conflict
- Facility-level segmentation can isolate shipping operations
- Foreign systems (like SAP) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical
- Segmentation doesn't prevent foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- This creates a logical inconsistency

### 2. Explores key interpretive questions
- What is "transportation system disruption"?
  - Facility operations only?
  - Broader maritime network?
  - Regional/national infrastructure?
- What is "particular area"?
  - The facility?
  - Port/maritime area?
  - Geographic region?
- What is the "could lead to" standard?
  - Direct causation only?
  - Indirect pathways?
  - Any potential pathway?

### 3. Presents potential interpretations
- Interpretation A: Facility-centric (narrow)
- Interpretation B: Network-centric (broad)
- Interpretation C: Impact-based (focus on consequences)

### 4. Provides reconciliation approaches
- Approach 1: Distinguish direct vs. indirect support
- Approach 2: Focus on operational independence
- Approach 3: Separate system location from system function
- Approach 4: Focus on "particular area" interpretation

### 5. Key insights
1. Segmentation and foreign systems are separate issues
   - Segmentation limits facility-level scope
   - Foreign system criticality is determined by operational dependency
2. Operational dependency is key
   - If SAP is required for shipping, it's likely critical regardless of location or segmentation
3. The conflict may require regulatory clarification
   - The logical inconsistency suggests the need for Coast Guard guidance

### 6. Recommended analysis framework
A 4-step process:
1. Assess operational dependency
2. Assess TSI pathway (direct/indirect/cascading)
3. Assess segmentation effectiveness
4. Assess foreign systems separately

### 7. Questions for Coast Guard engagement
Specific questions to ask the Coast Guard about:
- TSI definition clarification
- Critical asset scope
- Foreign systems assessment
- Segmentation and scope limitation
- Operational dependency thresholds

## Updated main research document

Added a section acknowledging the conflict and referencing the detailed analysis, with:
- Recognition of the logical inconsistency
- Clarification that segmentation and foreign systems are separate issues
- Emphasis on operational dependency as the key factor
- Recommendation to engage with Coast Guard for clarification

## Bottom line

The conflict is real and important. The analysis suggests:

1. Segmentation and foreign systems are separate assessments
   - Segmentation can limit facility-level scope
   - Foreign systems are assessed based on operational dependency

2. Operational dependency is the critical factor
   - If SAP is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of location or segmentation
   - The question: Can shipping operations function without SAP?

3. Regulatory clarification is needed
   - The "transportation system disruption" component needs clearer interpretation
   - Coast Guard engagement is essential before finalizing scope

4. The conflict may be unresolvable without guidance
   - Either the TSI definition has a narrower interpretation than assumed
   - Or foreign systems that could cause disruption are in scope regardless of segmentation
   - Or there's a distinction between "direct" and "indirect" support that needs clarification

The documents now provide a framework for understanding and addressing this conflict. The next step is to engage with the Coast Guard using the questions provided in the analysis document.

Should I help draft a specific set of questions for your Coast Guard engagement, or explore any other aspects of this conflict?

# TSI Interpretation: Trade/Commerce Impact vs. Company Profitability

## Key Finding: TSI Focuses on Trade and Commerce, Not Company Profitability

Research indicates that the **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** definition focuses on **broader impacts on trade, commerce, regional economies, and public welfare**, rather than on **individual company profitability**.

This distinction is crucial for understanding what systems are truly "critical" under MTSA.

---

## TSI Definition Review

A **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, **transportation system disruption**, or **economic disruption in a particular area**."

### Key Interpretive Points

1. **"Transportation System Disruption"** focuses on:
   - Disruption of maritime trade and commerce
   - Disruption of port operations
   - Disruption of supply chains affecting multiple entities
   - Disruption of the movement of goods and people
   - **NOT** disruption of individual company operations

2. **"Economic Disruption in a Particular Area"** focuses on:
   - Regional economic stability
   - Trade and commerce impacts
   - Effects on multiple businesses and consumers
   - Broader economic consequences
   - **NOT** individual company profitability

3. **"Particular Area"** refers to:
   - Geographic region (port area, maritime region, etc.)
   - Regional economy
   - Trade/commerce network
   - **NOT** individual facility operations

---

## Implications for Critical Asset Assessment

### What IS In Scope (Trade/Commerce Impact)

Systems whose compromise could lead to:

1. **Disruption of Maritime Trade/Commerce**
   - Port operations shutdown
   - Vessel traffic disruption
   - Cargo handling disruption affecting multiple entities
   - Supply chain disruption affecting regional commerce

2. **Disruption of Transportation Infrastructure**
   - Port facilities
   - Shipping channels
   - Cargo terminals
   - Vessel operations

3. **Regional Economic Impact**
   - Effects on multiple businesses
   - Consumer impacts
   - Regional economic stability
   - Trade flow disruption

4. **Public Safety and Environmental Impact**
   - Significant loss of life
   - Environmental damage
   - Public health impacts

### What MAY NOT Be In Scope (Company-Specific Impact)

Systems whose compromise would only affect:

1. **Individual Company Operations**
   - Internal business processes
   - Company-specific logistics
   - Internal operations not affecting trade/commerce

2. **Company Profitability**
   - Financial performance
   - Company-specific economic impacts
   - Internal business disruption

3. **Non-Trade Operations**
   - Systems supporting non-maritime operations
   - General business systems not affecting shipping
   - Systems that don't impact trade/commerce

---

## Application to Your Situation

### Foreign-Located SAP Logistics System

**Key Questions**:

1. **Does SAP disruption affect trade/commerce or just your company?**
   - If SAP disruption only affects your company's operations → May not be in scope
   - If SAP disruption affects port operations, vessel scheduling, or cargo movement affecting multiple entities → Likely in scope

2. **Does SAP disruption affect regional commerce?**
   - If disruption only impacts your company's profitability → May not be in scope
   - If disruption impacts regional trade, port operations, or supply chains → Likely in scope

3. **Is SAP required for maritime trade operations?**
   - If SAP is only used for internal logistics/accounting → May not be in scope
   - If SAP is required for vessel operations, cargo handling, or port operations → Likely in scope

### Network Segmentation

**Key Insight**: If you can demonstrate that:

1. **Non-shipping systems only affect company operations** (not trade/commerce)
2. **Non-shipping systems don't impact regional commerce**
3. **Non-shipping systems don't affect port/maritime operations**

Then segmentation may effectively limit scope, because these systems wouldn't cause "transportation system disruption" or "economic disruption in a particular area" as defined by MTSA.

---

## Assessment Framework: Trade/Commerce vs. Company Impact

### Step 1: Identify Trade/Commerce Impact

For each system, assess:

1. **Does system compromise affect port operations?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Does system compromise affect vessel operations?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

3. **Does system compromise affect cargo handling for multiple entities?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

4. **Does system compromise affect regional supply chains?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

5. **Does system compromise affect regional trade/commerce?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → May not be in scope

### Step 2: Identify Company-Specific Impact

For each system, assess:

1. **Does system compromise only affect your company's operations?**
   - Yes → May not be in scope (if no trade/commerce impact)
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Does system compromise only affect your company's profitability?**
   - Yes → May not be in scope (if no trade/commerce impact)
   - No → Continue assessment

3. **Does system compromise only affect internal business processes?**
   - Yes → May not be in scope (if no trade/commerce impact)
   - No → Continue assessment

### Step 3: Determine Criticality

**Critical if**:
- System compromise could cause trade/commerce disruption
- System compromise could affect regional economy
- System compromise could disrupt port/maritime operations
- System compromise could affect multiple entities

**May Not Be Critical if**:
- System compromise only affects individual company operations
- System compromise only affects company profitability
- System compromise doesn't impact trade/commerce
- System compromise doesn't affect regional economy

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Vessel Traffic Management System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects all vessels in port area
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: Yes - affects port operations and trade
- **Company Impact**: Yes, but broader than company-specific
- **Criticality**: **CRITICAL** - affects trade/commerce

### Example 2: Cargo Handling System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects cargo movement at facility
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: Yes - affects cargo flow and trade
- **Company Impact**: Yes, but affects trade/commerce
- **Criticality**: **CRITICAL** - affects trade/commerce

### Example 3: Internal Accounting System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects company financial operations
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: No - only affects company
- **Company Impact**: Yes - but only company-specific
- **Criticality**: **MAY NOT BE CRITICAL** - no trade/commerce impact

### Example 4: SAP Logistics System (Foreign-Located)
- **Impact**: Depends on function
  - If used for vessel scheduling affecting port operations → **CRITICAL**
  - If used for cargo tracking affecting trade → **CRITICAL**
  - If used only for internal logistics/accounting → **MAY NOT BE CRITICAL**

### Example 5: HR System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects company HR operations
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: No - only affects company
- **Company Impact**: Yes - but only company-specific
- **Criticality**: **MAY NOT BE CRITICAL** - no trade/commerce impact

---

## Resolving the Segmentation Conflict

### The Conflict Revisited

**Original Conflict**:
- Facility-level segmentation can isolate shipping operations
- Foreign systems (like SAP) could cause "transportation system disruption"
- Segmentation doesn't prevent foreign system compromise from causing disruption

### Resolution with Trade/Commerce Focus

**New Understanding**:
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of trade/commerce, not company operations
- If SAP only affects company operations (not trade/commerce), it may not be critical
- If SAP affects trade/commerce, it's critical regardless of location or segmentation

**Key Questions**:
1. **Does SAP disruption affect trade/commerce?**
   - If no → SAP may not be critical, segmentation can limit scope
   - If yes → SAP is critical, but segmentation may still limit scope of other systems

2. **Can you operate shipping without SAP affecting trade/commerce?**
   - If yes → SAP may not be critical
   - If no → SAP is critical

3. **Does SAP affect port operations, vessel operations, or cargo handling?**
   - If yes → SAP is critical
   - If no → SAP may not be critical

---

## Practical Application

### For Your SAP System

**Assessment Questions**:

1. **What is SAP's role in shipping operations?**
   - Vessel scheduling?
   - Cargo tracking?
   - Port operations?
   - Internal logistics only?

2. **If SAP is compromised, what is the impact?**
   - Port operations disruption?
   - Vessel operations disruption?
   - Cargo handling disruption affecting trade?
   - Only company operations disruption?

3. **Does SAP disruption affect multiple entities?**
   - Port operators?
   - Other shipping companies?
   - Regional trade/commerce?
   - Only your company?

### For Network Segmentation

**Assessment Questions**:

1. **Do non-shipping systems affect trade/commerce?**
   - If no → Segmentation may effectively limit scope
   - If yes → Systems are critical regardless of segmentation

2. **Can non-shipping systems cause "transportation system disruption"?**
   - If no → May not be in scope
   - If yes → Are critical

3. **Do non-shipping systems affect regional economy?**
   - If no → May not be in scope
   - If yes → Are critical

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Reframe Assessment Focus

Shift from "company operations impact" to **"trade/commerce impact"**:
- Assess whether systems affect trade/commerce
- Assess whether systems affect regional economy
- Assess whether systems affect port/maritime operations
- **NOT** whether systems affect company profitability

### 2. Document Trade/Commerce Analysis

For each system, document:
- Trade/commerce impact assessment
- Regional economic impact assessment
- Port/maritime operations impact assessment
- Company-specific impact (for comparison)

### 3. Engage Coast Guard with Trade/Commerce Focus

When engaging with Coast Guard, emphasize:
- Your understanding that TSI focuses on trade/commerce
- Your assessment of trade/commerce impacts
- Your identification of systems affecting trade/commerce vs. company operations
- Your proposed scope limitation based on trade/commerce impact

### 4. Use Segmentation Strategically

Segmentation can limit scope if you can demonstrate:
- Non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
- Non-shipping systems don't affect regional economy
- Non-shipping systems don't affect port/maritime operations
- Only shipping systems affect trade/commerce

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **TSI focuses on trade/commerce, not company profitability**
   - "Transportation system disruption" = trade/commerce disruption
   - "Economic disruption in particular area" = regional economic impact
   - Individual company impacts may not be in scope

2. **Critical assets are those affecting trade/commerce**
   - Systems affecting port operations
   - Systems affecting vessel operations
   - Systems affecting cargo handling and trade
   - Systems affecting regional commerce

3. **Company-specific systems may not be critical**
   - Internal business systems
   - Company-specific logistics
   - Systems only affecting company profitability
   - Systems not affecting trade/commerce

4. **Segmentation can limit scope if properly applied**
   - If non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
   - If segmentation prevents trade/commerce impact
   - If shipping systems are isolated from non-shipping systems

5. **Foreign systems assessed by trade/commerce impact**
   - If foreign system affects trade/commerce → Critical
   - If foreign system only affects company operations → May not be critical
   - Location is less relevant than trade/commerce impact

---

## Questions for Coast Guard Engagement

When engaging with Coast Guard, consider asking:

1. **TSI Interpretation**
   - Does "transportation system disruption" refer to trade/commerce disruption?
   - Does "economic disruption in particular area" refer to regional economic impact?
   - Are company-specific impacts (not affecting trade/commerce) in scope?

2. **Critical Asset Scope**
   - Are systems that only affect company operations (not trade/commerce) in scope?
   - Are systems that only affect company profitability in scope?
   - What is the threshold for trade/commerce impact?

3. **Segmentation and Scope Limitation**
   - Can segmentation limit scope if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce?
   - How do we demonstrate that systems don't affect trade/commerce?
   - What level of isolation is required?

4. **Foreign Systems**
   - How are foreign systems assessed for trade/commerce impact?
   - Are foreign systems that only affect company operations in scope?
   - What is the assessment approach for foreign systems?

---

## Conclusion

The distinction between **trade/commerce impact** and **company profitability** is crucial for understanding MTSA scope:

- **TSI focuses on trade/commerce, regional economy, and public welfare**
- **Company-specific impacts may not be in scope**
- **Critical assets are those affecting trade/commerce**
- **Segmentation can limit scope if properly applied**
- **Foreign systems assessed by trade/commerce impact, not location**

This interpretation can help resolve the conflict between segmentation and foreign systems by focusing on the **actual impact on trade/commerce** rather than company operations.

**Next Steps**:
1. Reframe your critical asset assessment using trade/commerce focus
2. Assess SAP and other systems for trade/commerce impact
3. Document your analysis clearly
4. Engage with Coast Guard using trade/commerce framework
5. Seek approval for scope limitation based on trade/commerce impact

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Critical Interpretation: Trade/Commerce Focus

**Important Finding**: The TSI definition focuses on **broader impacts on trade, commerce, regional economies, and public welfare**, rather than on **individual company profitability**.

**"Transportation System Disruption"** refers to:
- Disruption of maritime trade and commerce
- Disruption of port operations
- Disruption of supply chains affecting multiple entities
- Disruption of the movement of goods and people
- **NOT** disruption of individual company operations

**"Economic Disruption in a Particular Area"** refers to:
- Regional economic stability
- Trade and commerce impacts
- Effects on multiple businesses and consumers
- Broader economic consequences
- **NOT** individual company profitability

**Implication for Critical Asset Assessment**: Systems whose compromise would only affect individual company operations or profitability may **not be in scope** if they don't affect trade/commerce or regional economy.

**See**: `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework.

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

### U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-20

NVIC 01-20 provides guidelines for addressing cyber risks at MTSA-regulated facilities:

- **Facility Security Assessment (FSA)**: Must assess and document vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks
- **Facility Security Plan (FSP)**: Must address identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Alternative Security Program (ASP)**: Can be used as an alternative to FSP

### Key Requirements

1. **Cybersecurity Plan**: Develop and maintain a cybersecurity plan addressing identified risks
2. **Regular Updates**: Update plans to adapt to evolving threats and regulatory changes
3. **Reporting**: Report breaches of security, suspicious activities, and cyber incidents to appropriate authorities (e.g., National Response Center)

---

## 5. Best Practices and Frameworks

### Recommended Frameworks

   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**
   - Regularly update asset inventory
   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

### Important Conflict: Segmentation vs. Foreign-Located Systems

**The Conflict**: There is a logical inconsistency that needs to be addressed:

- **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations
- **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP logistics) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical assets
- **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are **separate issues**:
- **Segmentation** limits facility-level scope (proving non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping)
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway, not location
- If a foreign system (like SAP) is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Its location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

**The Critical Question**: Can shipping operations function without the foreign system?
- **If No** → System is critical and in scope regardless of location or segmentation
- **If Yes** → System may not be critical

**"Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**: The regulatory definition of TSI includes "transportation system disruption" but the interpretation is not clearly specified. This creates uncertainty about:
- What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
- What is the scope of "particular area"?
- What is the "could lead to" standard?

**Recommendation**: See the detailed analysis in `TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md` for a comprehensive exploration of this conflict and potential approaches to resolution.

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important Limitations**:
- Facility-level segmentation addresses facility systems, not foreign-located systems
- Foreign systems are assessed separately based on operational dependency
- The "transportation system disruption" component of TSI needs clarification
- **Engage with Coast Guard** to clarify TSI interpretation and scope before finalizing approach

---

## 11. Conclusion

Defining critical assets under MTSA requires a systematic, risk-based approach that focuses on preventing Transportation Security Incidents. Key takeaways:

1. **Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a TSI
2. **TSI scope** is clearly defined: significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption
3. **Industry practices** emphasize structured classification and risk-based assessment
4. **Regulatory guidance** is available through NVIC 01-20 and Coast Guard resources
5. **Frameworks** like NIST and CISA tools can support the assessment process

By following a structured approach and leveraging available resources, chemical companies can effectively identify critical assets and ensure compliance with MTSA cybersecurity requirements.

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Critical Interpretation: Trade/Commerce Focus

**Important Finding**: The TSI definition focuses on **broader impacts on trade, commerce, regional economies, and public welfare**, rather than on **individual company profitability**.

**"Transportation System Disruption"** refers to:
- Disruption of maritime trade and commerce
- Disruption of port operations
- Disruption of supply chains affecting multiple entities
- Disruption of the movement of goods and people
- **NOT** disruption of individual company operations

**"Economic Disruption in a Particular Area"** refers to:
- Regional economic stability
- Trade and commerce impacts
- Effects on multiple businesses and consumers
- Broader economic consequences
- **NOT** individual company profitability

**Implication for Critical Asset Assessment**: Systems whose compromise would only affect individual company operations or profitability may **not be in scope** if they don't affect trade/commerce or regional economy.

**See**: `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework.

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**

   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

### Important Conflict: Segmentation vs. Foreign-Located Systems

**The Conflict**: There is a logical inconsistency that needs to be addressed:

- **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations
- **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP logistics) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical assets
- **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are **separate issues**:
- **Segmentation** limits facility-level scope (proving non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping)
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway, not location
- If a foreign system (like SAP) is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Its location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

**The Critical Question**: Can shipping operations function without the foreign system?
- **If No** → System is critical and in scope regardless of location or segmentation
- **If Yes** → System may not be critical

**"Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**: The regulatory definition of TSI includes "transportation system disruption" but the interpretation is not clearly specified. This creates uncertainty about:
- What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
- What is the scope of "particular area"?
- What is the "could lead to" standard?

**Recommendation**: See the detailed analysis in `TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md` for a comprehensive exploration of this conflict and potential approaches to resolution.

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important Limitations**:
- Facility-level segmentation addresses facility systems, not foreign-located systems
- Foreign systems are assessed separately based on operational dependency
- The "transportation system disruption" component of TSI needs clarification
- **Engage with Coast Guard** to clarify TSI interpretation and scope before finalizing approach

---

## 11. Conclusion

Defining critical assets under MTSA requires a systematic, risk-based approach that focuses on preventing Transportation Security Incidents. Key takeaways:

1. **Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a TSI
2. **TSI scope** is clearly defined: significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption
3. **Industry practices** emphasize structured classification and risk-based assessment
4. **Regulatory guidance** is available through NVIC 01-20 and Coast Guard resources
5. **Frameworks** like NIST and CISA tools can support the assessment process

By following a structured approach and leveraging available resources, chemical companies can effectively identify critical assets and ensure compliance with MTSA cybersecurity requirements.

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Critical Interpretation: Trade/Commerce Focus

**Important Finding**: The TSI definition focuses on **broader impacts on trade, commerce, regional economies, and public welfare**, rather than on **individual company profitability**.

**"Transportation System Disruption"** refers to:
- Disruption of maritime trade and commerce
- Disruption of port operations
- Disruption of supply chains affecting multiple entities
- Disruption of the movement of goods and people
- **NOT** disruption of individual company operations

**"Economic Disruption in a Particular Area"** refers to:
- Regional economic stability
- Trade and commerce impacts
- Effects on multiple businesses and consumers
- Broader economic consequences
- **NOT** individual company profitability

**Implication for Critical Asset Assessment**: Systems whose compromise would only affect individual company operations or profitability may **not be in scope** if they don't affect trade/commerce or regional economy.

**See**: `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework.

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

### U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-20

NVIC 01-20 provides guidelines for addressing cyber risks at MTSA-regulated facilities:

- **Facility Security Assessment (FSA)**: Must assess and document vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks
- **Facility Security Plan (FSP)**: Must address identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Alternative Security Program (ASP)**: Can be used as an alternative to FSP

## 7. Recommended Approach for Chemical Companies

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Initial Asset Inventory**
   - Compile comprehensive list of all IT and OT systems
   - Include systems that impact maritime operations
   - Document network diagrams and existing cybersecurity policies

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate each asset's potential to contribute to a TSI
   - Consider:
     - Operational impact if compromised
     - Connection to physical processes involving COI
     - Interdependencies with other critical systems
     - Data sensitivity and potential for exploitation

3. **Classification**
   - Classify assets into criticality levels (Very High, High, Medium, Low)
   - Focus on assets that could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
   - Document rationale for each classification

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current security measures against identified risks
   - Identify vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

5. **Cybersecurity Plan Development**
   - Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP or ASP
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Include measures to protect critical assets
   - Establish incident response procedures

6. **Ongoing Management**
   - Regularly update asset inventory
   - Reassess criticality as operations change
   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

### Important Conflict: Segmentation vs. Foreign-Located Systems

**The Conflict**: There is a logical inconsistency that needs to be addressed:

- **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations
- **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP logistics) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical assets
- **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are **separate issues**:
- **Segmentation** limits facility-level scope (proving non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping)
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway, not location
- If a foreign system (like SAP) is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Its location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

**The Critical Question**: Can shipping operations function without the foreign system?
- **If No** → System is critical and in scope regardless of location or segmentation
- **If Yes** → System may not be critical

**"Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**: Research indicates that "transportation system disruption" refers to **disruption of trade/commerce and regional economy**, not individual company operations. This interpretation can help resolve the conflict:

- **If foreign systems only affect company operations** (not trade/commerce) → May not be in scope
- **If foreign systems affect trade/commerce** → Are critical regardless of location
- **Segmentation can limit scope** if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce

**Key Insight**: The focus should be on **trade/commerce impact**, not company profitability.

**Recommendations**: 
- See `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework
- See `TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md` for comprehensive exploration of the conflict

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important Limitations**:
- Facility-level segmentation addresses facility systems, not foreign-located systems
- Foreign systems are assessed separately based on operational dependency
- The "transportation system disruption" component of TSI needs clarification
- **Engage with Coast Guard** to clarify TSI interpretation and scope before finalizing approach

---

## 11. Conclusion

Defining critical assets under MTSA requires a systematic, risk-based approach that focuses on preventing Transportation Security Incidents. Key takeaways:

1. **Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a TSI
2. **TSI scope** is clearly defined: significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption
3. **Industry practices** emphasize structured classification and risk-based assessment
4. **Regulatory guidance** is available through NVIC 01-20 and Coast Guard resources
5. **Frameworks** like NIST and CISA tools can support the assessment process

By following a structured approach and leveraging available resources, chemical companies can effectively identify critical assets and ensure compliance with MTSA cybersecurity requirements.

# Understanding the "Transportation System Disruption" Conflict

## The Core Conflict

You've identified a critical logical inconsistency:

1. **Network segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations at the facility level
2. **Foreign-located logistics systems** (like SAP) could cause "transportation system disruption" if compromised
3. **Facility-level segmentation** doesn't prevent disruption if the foreign system itself is compromised
4. **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

This document explores this conflict and seeks to clarify the interpretation of "transportation system disruption" in the TSI definition.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: Research indicates that "transportation system disruption" refers to **disruption of trade/commerce and regional economy**, not individual company operations. This interpretation may help resolve the conflict. See `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis.

## TSI Definition Review

A **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, **transportation system disruption**, or economic disruption in a **particular area**."

### Key Questions for Interpretation

1. **What is "transportation system disruption"?**
   - Disruption of the facility's shipping operations?
   - Disruption of the broader maritime transportation network?
   - Disruption of regional/national transportation infrastructure?
   - Any disruption affecting transportation services?

2. **What is "particular area"?**
   - The facility itself?
   - The local port/maritime area?
   - A regional transportation network?
   - A geographic region?

3. **What is the "could lead to" standard?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways through cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway, no matter how remote?

---

## The Segmentation vs. Foreign System Conflict

### Scenario Analysis

#### Scenario 1: Facility-Level Segmentation
- **Setup**: Shipping operations network is isolated from general business network
- **Assumption**: Non-shipping systems cannot access shipping systems
- **Question**: Does this mean non-shipping systems are out of scope?

#### Scenario 2: Foreign-Located Critical System
- **Setup**: SAP logistics system is located in another country
- **Function**: Manages logistics, cargo tracking, vessel scheduling
- **Impact if Compromised**: Could disrupt shipping operations, causing transportation system disruption
- **Question**: Is SAP in scope even though it's foreign-located?

#### The Conflict
- If SAP can cause "transportation system disruption" (a TSI component), it's likely a critical asset
- Facility-level segmentation doesn't prevent SAP from being compromised
- Facility-level segmentation doesn't prevent SAP compromise from causing disruption
- **Therefore**: How does segmentation help limit scope if foreign systems are still in scope?

---

## Research Findings: "Transportation System Disruption"

### Regulatory Text Search

**33 CFR 101.105** defines TSI, but specific interpretation of "transportation system disruption" is not detailed in readily available public sources.

### Key Interpretive Questions

1. **Scope of "Transportation System"**
   - **Narrow Interpretation**: The facility's transportation operations only
   - **Broad Interpretation**: The broader maritime transportation network/port area
   - **Very Broad**: Regional or national transportation infrastructure

2. **Scope of "Disruption"**
   - **Minimal**: Any interruption of normal operations
   - **Moderate**: Significant operational impact
   - **Severe**: Complete shutdown or major failure

3. **Scope of "Particular Area"**
   - **Facility**: The MTSA-regulated facility itself
   - **Port Area**: The port/maritime area where the facility operates
   - **Regional**: A broader geographic region affected by the disruption

### Potential Interpretations

#### Interpretation A: Facility-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the facility's shipping operations
- "Particular area" = the facility or immediate port area
- **Implication**: If you can segment and prove non-shipping systems can't disrupt shipping operations, they may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system is required for shipping operations, it's in scope regardless of location

#### Interpretation B: Network-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the broader maritime transportation network
- "Particular area" = the port/maritime area or regional network
- **Implication**: Any system that could disrupt the broader network is in scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system could affect the broader network, it's in scope

#### Interpretation C: Impact-Based
- "Transportation system disruption" = any disruption that affects transportation services in a particular area
- "Particular area" = defined by the impact, not geography
- **Implication**: Focus on impact, not location or direct connection
- **Foreign Systems**: If impact could reach transportation services, it's in scope

---

## The "Could Lead To" Standard

### Critical Asset Definition

Critical assets are those **"whose compromise could lead to a TSI"**.

### Key Questions

1. **What does "could lead to" mean?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways?
   - Cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway?

2. **How remote can the pathway be?**
   - Must be direct and immediate?
   - Can include indirect dependencies?
   - Can include multiple steps?

3. **What is the burden of proof?**
   - Must prove it could happen?
   - Must prove it's likely?
   - Must prove there's no pathway?

### Potential Standards

#### Standard 1: Direct Causation
- Asset compromise must directly cause TSI
- No intermediate steps
- **Example**: Compromise of vessel traffic system directly causes collision

#### Standard 2: Reasonable Pathway
- Asset compromise must have a reasonable pathway to TSI
- Can include intermediate steps if logical
- **Example**: Compromise of logistics system → incorrect cargo manifests → safety incident

#### Standard 3: Any Potential Pathway
- Asset compromise must have any potential pathway to TSI, no matter how remote
- Includes theoretical possibilities
- **Example**: Any system that could theoretically affect operations

---

## Reconciling the Conflict: Potential Approaches

### Approach 1: Distinguish Between Direct and Indirect Support

**Concept**: Distinguish between systems that "directly support" shipping operations vs. those that "indirectly support" or "could theoretically affect" operations.

**Application**:
- **Direct Support**: Systems required for shipping operations to function
  - Vessel traffic management
  - Cargo handling systems
  - Loading/unloading controls
  - **Foreign Systems**: If SAP is required for shipping operations, it directly supports them
  
- **Indirect Support**: Systems that support business operations but aren't required for shipping
  - General business systems
  - HR systems
  - Finance systems (unless required for shipping)
  - **Segmentation**: If properly isolated, these may be out of scope

**Key Question**: Can you operate shipping without SAP? If no, SAP directly supports shipping and is in scope regardless of location.

### Approach 2: Focus on Operational Independence

**Concept**: If shipping operations can function independently of non-shipping systems, those systems may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
- **If Yes**: Non-shipping systems may be out of scope (with proper segmentation)
- **If No**: Non-shipping systems are in scope

**Foreign Systems**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if SAP fails?
- **If Yes**: SAP may not be critical (unlikely for logistics system)
- **If No**: SAP is critical and in scope

**Segmentation Role**: Segmentation helps prove operational independence by preventing non-shipping systems from affecting shipping systems.

### Approach 3: Distinguish Between System Location and System Function

**Concept**: The location of a system (foreign vs. domestic) is separate from whether it's critical. Segmentation addresses facility-level scope, not foreign system criticality.

**Application**:
- **Facility-Level Segmentation**: Limits scope of facility systems
  - Isolates shipping operations from non-shipping operations
  - Proves non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping
  
- **Foreign System Assessment**: Separate assessment of foreign systems
  - If foreign system is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of location
  - Segmentation doesn't change foreign system criticality
  - But segmentation may prevent foreign system compromise from affecting non-shipping facility systems

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are separate issues:
- Segmentation limits **facility-level** scope
- Foreign system criticality is determined by **operational dependency**, not location

### Approach 4: Focus on "Particular Area" Interpretation

**Concept**: If "particular area" means the facility or immediate port area, then systems that only affect broader operations may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Facility/Port Area Impact**: Systems that could disrupt facility/port operations are in scope
- **Broader Impact Only**: Systems that only affect broader operations (not facility/port) may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If SAP disruption only affects broader logistics (not facility operations), may be out of scope

**Challenge**: This interpretation may be too narrow and may not align with Coast Guard expectations.

---

## Recommended Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Assess Operational Dependency

For each system (facility or foreign):

1. **Is the system required for shipping operations to function?**
   - Yes → Likely critical
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Can shipping operations continue if this system fails?**
   - No → Likely critical
   - Yes → May not be critical

3. **What is the maximum acceptable downtime?**
   - Minutes/hours → Likely critical
   - Days/weeks → May not be critical

### Step 2: Assess TSI Pathway

For each system:

1. **Direct Pathway**: Can system compromise directly cause TSI?
   - Example: Vessel traffic system → collision
   - If yes → Critical

2. **Indirect Pathway**: Can system compromise lead to TSI through intermediate steps?
   - Example: Logistics system → incorrect cargo → safety incident
   - Assess reasonableness of pathway

3. **Cascading Failure**: Could system failure cascade to critical systems?
   - Assess interdependencies
   - Evaluate segmentation effectiveness

### Step 3: Assess Segmentation Effectiveness

For facility-level systems:

1. **Can segmentation prevent access to shipping systems?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

2. **Can segmentation prevent impact on shipping operations?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

3. **Is operational independence proven?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

### Step 4: Assess Foreign Systems Separately

For foreign-located systems:

1. **Operational Dependency**: Is system required for shipping?
   - Yes → Likely critical regardless of location
   - No → May not be critical

2. **TSI Pathway**: Can compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Yes → Critical
   - No → May not be critical

3. **Segmentation Role**: Can facility segmentation prevent foreign system from affecting non-shipping systems?
   - Yes → Segmentation helps limit scope of impact
   - No → Foreign system affects entire facility scope

---

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Insight 1: Segmentation and Foreign Systems Are Separate Issues

- **Segmentation** addresses facility-level scope limitation
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway
- Segmentation doesn't change whether a foreign system is critical
- But segmentation may limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise

### Insight 2: The "Transportation System Disruption" Question Needs Clarification

- The regulatory definition is not specific
- Interpretation may vary
- **Recommendation**: Engage with Coast Guard to clarify:
  - What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
  - What is the scope of "particular area"?
  - What is the "could lead to" standard?

### Insight 3: Operational Dependency Is Key

- If SAP is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

- The question is: **Can shipping operations function without SAP?**
  - If no → SAP is critical
  - If yes → SAP may not be critical

### Insight 4: Segmentation May Still Have Value

Even if foreign systems are critical, facility-level segmentation may:
- Limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise
- Prevent non-shipping systems from being affected
- Demonstrate operational independence of shipping operations
- Reduce overall risk surface

### Insight 5: The Conflict May Be Unresolvable Without Regulatory Clarification

The logical conflict you've identified suggests that:
- Either "transportation system disruption" has a narrower interpretation than assumed
- Or foreign systems that could cause disruption are in scope regardless of segmentation
- Or there's a distinction between "direct support" and "indirect support" that needs clarification

---

## Questions for Coast Guard Engagement

When engaging with the Coast Guard, consider asking:

1. **TSI Definition Clarification**
   - What specifically constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
   - What is the scope of "particular area"?
   - Are there examples or case studies of what constitutes a TSI?

2. **Critical Asset Scope**
   - What is the "could lead to" standard?
   - Must the pathway be direct, or can it be indirect?
   - How remote can the pathway be?

3. **Foreign Systems**
   - How are foreign-located systems assessed?
   - Does location affect criticality assessment?
   - How do foreign systems fit into facility security plans?

4. **Segmentation and Scope Limitation**
   - Can network segmentation limit the scope of critical assets?
   - What level of isolation is required?
   - How is operational independence demonstrated?

5. **Operational Dependency**
   - How is "required for operations" defined?
   - What is the threshold for operational dependency?
   - How is acceptable downtime determined?

---

## Conclusion

The conflict you've identified is real and important:

1. **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping from non-shipping operations
2. **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical
3. **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
4. **Therefore**: There's a logical inconsistency that needs resolution

**Potential Resolutions**:

1. **Narrow TSI Interpretation**: "Transportation system disruption" may have a narrower scope than assumed
2. **Operational Dependency Focus**: If SAP is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of segmentation
3. **Separate Assessments**: Segmentation limits facility scope; foreign systems assessed separately
4. **Regulatory Clarification Needed**: The conflict suggests need for Coast Guard guidance

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Engage Coast Guard**: Seek clarification on TSI definition and scope
2. **Assess Operational Dependency**: Determine if SAP is truly required for shipping
3. **Document Analysis**: Clearly document your assessment and reasoning
4. **Propose Approach**: Present your analysis and proposed scope limitation to Coast Guard
5. **Seek Approval**: Get Coast Guard acceptance of your approach before finalizing FSP

The key is to **acknowledge the conflict, analyze it thoroughly, and seek regulatory clarification** rather than assuming one interpretation over another.

   - **Regional**: A broader geographic region affected by the disruption

### Potential Interpretations

#### Interpretation A: Facility-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the facility's shipping operations
- "Particular area" = the facility or immediate port area
- **Implication**: If you can segment and prove non-shipping systems can't disrupt shipping operations, they may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system is required for shipping operations, it's in scope regardless of location

#### Interpretation B: Network-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the broader maritime transportation network
- "Particular area" = the port/maritime area or regional network
- **Implication**: Any system that could disrupt the broader network is in scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system could affect the broader network, it's in scope

#### Interpretation C: Impact-Based
- "Transportation system disruption" = any disruption that affects transportation services in a particular area
- "Particular area" = defined by the impact, not geography
- **Implication**: Focus on impact, not location or direct connection
- **Foreign Systems**: If impact could reach transportation services, it's in scope

## The "Could Lead To" Standard

### Critical Asset Definition

Critical assets are those **"whose compromise could lead to a TSI"**.

### Key Questions

1. **What does "could lead to" mean?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways?
   - Cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway?

2. **How remote can the pathway be?**
   - Must be direct and immediate?
   - Can include indirect dependencies?
   - Can include multiple steps?

3. **What is the burden of proof?**
   - Must prove it could happen?
   - Must prove it's likely?
   - Must prove there's no pathway?

### Potential Standards

#### Standard 1: Direct Causation
- Asset compromise must directly cause TSI
- No intermediate steps
- **Example**: Compromise of vessel traffic system directly causes collision

#### Standard 2: Reasonable Pathway
- Asset compromise must have a reasonable pathway to TSI
- Can include intermediate steps if logical
- **Example**: Compromise of logistics system → incorrect cargo manifests → safety incident

#### Standard 3: Any Potential Pathway
- Asset compromise must have any potential pathway to TSI, no matter how remote
- Includes theoretical possibilities
- **Example**: Any system that could theoretically affect operations

---

## Reconciling the Conflict: Potential Approaches

### Approach 1: Distinguish Between Direct and Indirect Support

**Concept**: Distinguish between systems that "directly support" shipping operations vs. those that "indirectly support" or "could theoretically affect" operations.

**Application**:
- **Direct Support**: Systems required for shipping operations to function
  - Vessel traffic management
  - Cargo handling systems
  - Loading/unloading controls
  - **Foreign Systems**: If SAP is required for shipping operations, it directly supports them
  
- **Indirect Support**: Systems that support business operations but aren't required for shipping
  - General business systems
  - HR systems
  - Finance systems (unless required for shipping)
  - **Segmentation**: If properly isolated, these may be out of scope

**Key Question**: Can you operate shipping without SAP? If no, SAP directly supports shipping and is in scope regardless of location.

### Approach 2: Focus on Operational Independence

**Concept**: If shipping operations can function independently of non-shipping systems, those systems may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
- **If Yes**: Non-shipping systems may be out of scope (with proper segmentation)
- **If No**: Non-shipping systems are in scope

**Foreign Systems**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if SAP fails?
- **If Yes**: SAP may not be critical (unlikely for logistics system)
- **If No**: SAP is critical and in scope

**Segmentation Role**: Segmentation helps prove operational independence by preventing non-shipping systems from affecting shipping systems.

### Approach 3: Distinguish Between System Location and System Function

**Concept**: The location of a system (foreign vs. domestic) is separate from whether it's critical. Segmentation addresses facility-level scope, not foreign system criticality.

**Application**:
- **Facility-Level Segmentation**: Limits scope of facility systems
  - Isolates shipping operations from non-shipping operations
  - Proves non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping
  
- **Foreign System Assessment**: Separate assessment of foreign systems
  - If foreign system is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of location
  - Segmentation doesn't change foreign system criticality
  - But segmentation may prevent foreign system compromise from affecting non-shipping facility systems

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are separate issues:
- Segmentation limits **facility-level** scope
- Foreign system criticality is determined by **operational dependency**, not location

### Approach 4: Focus on "Particular Area" Interpretation

**Concept**: If "particular area" means the facility or immediate port area, then systems that only affect broader operations may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Facility/Port Area Impact**: Systems that could disrupt facility/port operations are in scope
- **Broader Impact Only**: Systems that only affect broader operations (not facility/port) may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If SAP disruption only affects broader logistics (not facility operations), may be out of scope

**Challenge**: This interpretation may be too narrow and may not align with Coast Guard expectations.

## Recommended Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Assess Operational Dependency

For each system (facility or foreign):

1. **Is the system required for shipping operations to function?**
   - Yes → Likely critical
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Can shipping operations continue if this system fails?**
   - No → Likely critical
   - Yes → May not be critical

3. **What is the maximum acceptable downtime?**
   - Minutes/hours → Likely critical
   - Days/weeks → May not be critical

### Step 2: Assess TSI Pathway

For each system:

1. **Direct Pathway**: Can system compromise directly cause TSI?
   - Example: Vessel traffic system → collision
   - If yes → Critical

2. **Indirect Pathway**: Can system compromise lead to TSI through intermediate steps?
   - Example: Logistics system → incorrect cargo → safety incident
   - Assess reasonableness of pathway

3. **Cascading Failure**: Could system failure cascade to critical systems?
   - Assess interdependencies
   - Evaluate segmentation effectiveness

### Step 3: Assess Segmentation Effectiveness

For facility-level systems:

1. **Can segmentation prevent access to shipping systems?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

2. **Can segmentation prevent impact on shipping operations?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

3. **Is operational independence proven?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

### Step 4: Assess Foreign Systems Separately

For foreign-located systems:

1. **Operational Dependency**: Is system required for shipping?
   - Yes → Likely critical regardless of location
   - No → May not be critical

2. **TSI Pathway**: Can compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Yes → Critical
   - No → May not be critical

3. **Segmentation Role**: Can facility segmentation prevent foreign system from affecting non-shipping systems?
   - Yes → Segmentation helps limit scope of impact
   - No → Foreign system affects entire facility scope

---

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Insight 1: Segmentation and Foreign Systems Are Separate Issues

- **Segmentation** addresses facility-level scope limitation
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway
- Segmentation doesn't change whether a foreign system is critical
- But segmentation may limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise

### Insight 2: The "Transportation System Disruption" Question Needs Clarification

- The regulatory definition is not specific
- Interpretation may vary
- **Recommendation**: Engage with Coast Guard to clarify:
  - What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
  - What is the scope of "particular area"?
  - What is the "could lead to" standard?

### Insight 3: Operational Dependency Is Key

- If SAP is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

- The question is: **Can shipping operations function without SAP?**
  - If no → SAP is critical
  - If yes → SAP may not be critical

### Insight 4: Segmentation May Still Have Value

Even if foreign systems are critical, facility-level segmentation may:
- Limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise
- Prevent non-shipping systems from being affected
- Demonstrate operational independence of shipping operations
- Reduce overall risk surface

### Insight 5: The Conflict May Be Unresolvable Without Regulatory Clarification

The logical conflict you've identified suggests that:
- Either "transportation system disruption" has a narrower interpretation than assumed
- Or foreign systems that could cause disruption are in scope regardless of segmentation
- Or there's a distinction between "direct support" and "indirect support" that needs clarification

---

## Questions for Coast Guard Engagement

When engaging with the Coast Guard, consider asking:

1. **TSI Definition Clarification**
   - What specifically constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
   - What is the scope of "particular area"?
   - Are there examples or case studies of what constitutes a TSI?

2. **Critical Asset Scope**
   - What is the "could lead to" standard?
   - Must the pathway be direct, or can it be indirect?
   - How remote can the pathway be?

3. **Foreign Systems**
   - How are foreign-located systems assessed?
   - Does location affect criticality assessment?
   - How do foreign systems fit into facility security plans?

4. **Segmentation and Scope Limitation**
   - Can network segmentation limit the scope of critical assets?
   - What level of isolation is required?
   - How is operational independence demonstrated?

5. **Operational Dependency**
   - How is "required for operations" defined?
   - What is the threshold for operational dependency?
   - How is acceptable downtime determined?

---

## Conclusion

The conflict you've identified is real and important:

1. **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping from non-shipping operations
2. **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical
3. **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
4. **Therefore**: There's a logical inconsistency that needs resolution

**IMPORTANT RESOLUTION PATH**: Research indicates that "transportation system disruption" focuses on **trade/commerce impact**, not company operations. This means:
- If foreign systems only affect company operations (not trade/commerce) → May not be in scope
- If foreign systems affect trade/commerce → Are critical regardless of location
- Segmentation can limit scope if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce

**See `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework.**

**Potential Resolutions**:

1. **Narrow TSI Interpretation**: "Transportation system disruption" may have a narrower scope than assumed
2. **Operational Dependency Focus**: If SAP is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of segmentation
3. **Separate Assessments**: Segmentation limits facility scope; foreign systems assessed separately
4. **Regulatory Clarification Needed**: The conflict suggests need for Coast Guard guidance

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Engage Coast Guard**: Seek clarification on TSI definition and scope
2. **Assess Operational Dependency**: Determine if SAP is truly required for shipping
3. **Document Analysis**: Clearly document your assessment and reasoning
4. **Propose Approach**: Present your analysis and proposed scope limitation to Coast Guard
5. **Seek Approval**: Get Coast Guard acceptance of your approach before finalizing FSP

The key is to **acknowledge the conflict, analyze it thoroughly, and seek regulatory clarification** rather than assuming one interpretation over another.

Created guidance on the trade/commerce vs. company profitability distinction. Summary:

## Created: TSI Trade/Commerce Interpretation Guide

A new document (`TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md`) that:

### 1. Clarifies the TSI focus
- TSI focuses on trade/commerce, regional economy, and public welfare
- Not individual company profitability
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of trade/commerce
- "Economic disruption in particular area" = regional economic impact

### 2. Implications for critical asset assessment

What is in scope (trade/commerce impact):
- Systems affecting port operations
- Systems affecting vessel operations
- Systems affecting cargo handling and trade
- Systems affecting regional commerce

What may not be in scope (company-specific impact):
- Internal business systems
- Company-specific logistics
- Systems only affecting company profitability
- Systems not affecting trade/commerce

### 3. Resolves the segmentation conflict

The trade/commerce focus helps resolve the conflict:

- If SAP only affects company operations (not trade/commerce) → May not be critical
- If SAP affects trade/commerce → Critical regardless of location
- Segmentation can limit scope if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce

### 4. Assessment framework

A 3-step framework:
1. Identify trade/commerce impact
   - Does it affect port operations?
   - Does it affect vessel operations?
   - Does it affect regional trade/commerce?
2. Identify company-specific impact
   - Does it only affect company operations?
   - Does it only affect company profitability?
3. Determine criticality
   - Critical if trade/commerce impact
   - May not be critical if only company impact

### 5. Application to your SAP system

Key questions:
- Does SAP disruption affect trade/commerce or just your company?
- Does SAP disruption affect regional commerce?
- Is SAP required for maritime trade operations?

If SAP only affects:
- Internal logistics → May not be critical
- Company operations → May not be critical
- Company profitability → May not be critical

If SAP affects:
- Port operations → Critical
- Vessel operations → Critical
- Cargo handling and trade → Critical
- Regional commerce → Critical

### 6. Examples

- Vessel Traffic Management → Critical (affects trade/commerce)
- Cargo Handling System → Critical (affects trade/commerce)
- Internal Accounting System → May not be critical (only company impact)
- SAP (if used for vessel scheduling) → Critical (affects trade/commerce)
- SAP (if used only for internal logistics) → May not be critical (only company impact)
- HR System → May not be critical (only company impact)

## Updated documents

1. Main research document — Added trade/commerce interpretation to the TSI definition section
2. TSI Transportation Disruption Analysis — Added reference to the trade/commerce finding

## Bottom line

This distinction can help resolve the conflict:

1. Reframe assessment: Focus on trade/commerce impact, not company operations
2. Assess SAP: Determine if SAP affects trade/commerce or only company operations
3. Apply segmentation: If non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce, segmentation can limit scope
4. Document analysis: Clearly document trade/commerce vs. company impact for each system
5. Engage Coast Guard: Use the trade/commerce framework when discussing scope

The key question for your SAP system: Does SAP disruption affect trade/commerce (port operations, vessel operations, cargo handling, regional commerce) or only your company's operations and profitability?

If it's the latter, SAP may not be critical under MTSA, which would resolve the segmentation conflict.

Should I help you assess your SAP system using this trade/commerce framework, or create a template for documenting this analysis?

**User**

thank you.  another task that could use your input, we are a very large chemical company with a very mature cyber security programm (both IT and OT).  we have a consolidated (IT/OT) corporate requirements framework.  we employ best in class architecture design implementations for our OT environemnts.  we do not have or require any remote operations as all of our plants are manned.  with this in mind, can you look at the MTSA requirements again and see how we may should compliance without a significant amount of duplication of effort for four sites impacted  out of 300+ sites globally

2. Site level: Create site-specific plans that reference the corporate framework
3. Site-specific additions: Add only maritime-specific and site-unique elements

### Effort reduction: 65–70%

- Independent approach: ~24–32 person-months
- Corporate framework approach: ~8–11 person-months
- Reduction: ~65–70% less effort

### What corporate framework can satisfy

- Technical measures: Account, device, data security, network segmentation (your OT architecture), risk management, resilience
- Organizational capabilities: Training program, incident response, recordkeeping, audit/compliance
- Architecture: Best-in-class OT design, network segmentation, security controls

### What needs to be site-specific

- Maritime operations description
- Critical asset identification (maritime-focused)
- TSI pathway analysis
- FSP integration
- Site-specific contacts and coordination

### Implementation model

#### Corporate work (do once, ~6–8 months)
1. Document corporate cybersecurity framework
2. Develop maritime-specific extensions (training, NRC reporting, scenarios)
3. Create site plan templates

#### Site work (per site, ~2–3 weeks per site)
1. Conduct site-specific maritime assessment
2. Identify site-specific critical assets
3. Develop site plan using template
4. Integrate with site FSP

### Key features

1. Corporate framework document: Single document describing all corporate capabilities
2. Site plan template: Template for site-specific plans (mostly references corporate framework)
3. Coast Guard submission strategy: Submit corporate framework once, site plans reference it
4. Reuse strategy: Maritime content developed once, used at all 4 sites

### Requirement-by-requirement approach

For each of the 8 MTSA requirements, the document shows:
- What corporate framework provides
- What needs to be site-specific
- How to implement efficiently
- Expected effort reduction

### Benefits

1. Efficiency: 65–70% reduction in total effort
2. Consistency: Same approach across all 4 sites
3. Quality: Leverages your mature cybersecurity program
4. Maintainability: Update corporate framework once, all sites benefit
5. Cost: Significant cost reduction compared to independent approach

### Timeline

- **Strategy**: Leverage corporate framework, document once, reference in site plans
- **Efficiency Target**: 65-70% reduction in effort compared to site-by-site approach

---

## Key Research Findings

### 1. TSI Interpretation
- **TSI Focus**: Trade/commerce impact, NOT company profitability
- **"Transportation System Disruption"**: Disruption of trade/commerce, not company operations
- **"Economic Disruption"**: Regional economic impact, not company financial impact
- **Implication**: Systems affecting only company operations may not be critical

### 2. Critical Asset Definition
- **Definition**: Assets whose compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI)
- **Key Question**: Does compromise affect trade/commerce or only company operations?
- **Assessment**: Focus on trade/commerce impact, not company profitability

### 3. Network Segmentation
- **Approach**: Can limit scope similar to physical TWIC isolation
- **Principle**: Prove non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
- **Challenge**: Foreign-located systems (e.g., SAP) may still be critical if affecting trade/commerce

### 4. Foreign-Located Systems
- **Principle**: Location doesn't determine criticality
- **Assessment**: Based on trade/commerce impact, not location
- **Example**: SAP logistics system assessed by trade/commerce impact, not location

### 5. Corporate Framework Leverage
- **ISO 27001**: Can satisfy most MTSA technical requirements
- **Corporate Framework**: Can satisfy most MTSA organizational requirements
- **Site-Specific**: Only maritime operations and FSP integration need to be site-specific

# MTSA Critical Assets and TSI Scope Research

## Executive Summary

This document provides research findings on how to define critical assets under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and understand the scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI) for Coast Guard-regulated chemical facilities.

---

## 1. Definition of Critical Assets Under MTSA

### Regulatory Definition

**Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**, which is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption in a particular area."

### Key Characteristics of Critical Assets

Critical assets typically include systems that:

1. **Operational Impact**: Assets that, if compromised, would disrupt essential maritime operations or services
2. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Systems susceptible to cyber threats that could be exploited to cause a TSI
3. **Interdependencies**: Assets whose failure would adversely affect other critical systems or processes
4. **Control Functions**: Systems that monitor or control physical processes involving chemicals of interest (COI)
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Systems containing sensitive information that could be exploited to steal, divert, or sabotage COI
6. **Interconnectivity**: Assets connected to systems managing physical processes involving COI

---

## 2. Scope of Transportation Security Incidents (TSI)

### TSI Definition

A TSI encompasses security incidents that result in:

- **Significant loss of life**
- **Environmental damage**
- **Transportation system disruption**
- **Economic disruption in a particular area**

### Important Considerations

- **Not all cybersecurity threats will cause or contribute to a TSI**
- Focus on threats that could lead to a TSI to prevent "scope creep"
- Security measures should be appropriately targeted to prevent TSIs
- When assessing assets, consider whether their compromise could contribute to such incidents

### Critical Interpretation: Trade/Commerce Focus

**Important Finding**: The TSI definition focuses on **broader impacts on trade, commerce, regional economies, and public welfare**, rather than on **individual company profitability**.

**"Transportation System Disruption"** refers to:
- Disruption of maritime trade and commerce
- Disruption of port operations
- Disruption of supply chains affecting multiple entities
- Disruption of the movement of goods and people
- **NOT** disruption of individual company operations

**"Economic Disruption in a Particular Area"** refers to:
- Regional economic stability
- Trade and commerce impacts
- Effects on multiple businesses and consumers
- Broader economic consequences
- **NOT** individual company profitability

**Implication for Critical Asset Assessment**: Systems whose compromise would only affect individual company operations or profitability may **not be in scope** if they don't affect trade/commerce or regional economy.

**See**: `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework.

### Examples of Assets That Could Lead to TSI

- Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- Safety systems (emergency shutdown systems, fire suppression)
- Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- Communication systems critical to operations
- Systems managing vessel traffic or cargo operations
- Environmental monitoring and response systems

---

## 3. How Companies Are Defining Critical Assets

### Industry Classification Approaches

Many organizations use structured classification frameworks with levels such as:

#### **Very High Criticality**
- Assets essential to the survival and continuity of the business
- Compromise could result in catastrophic consequences
- Directly linked to preventing TSIs

#### **High Criticality**
- Assets whose compromise would cause significant operational disruption
- Important to mission-critical operations
- Could contribute to a TSI if compromised

#### **Medium Criticality**
- Assets important but not vital
- Compromise would have moderate impact
- May indirectly affect critical operations

#### **Low Criticality**
- Assets with minimal impact if compromised
- Not directly related to TSI prevention

### Common Industry Practices

1. **Asset Inventory and Classification**
   - Catalog all IT and OT systems
   - Classify based on criticality to operations
   - Document asset roles, criticality, and associated risks

2. **Risk-Based Assessment**
   - Evaluate potential impact of each asset's compromise
   - Consider asset's role in critical processes
   - Assess data sensitivity and system connectivity
   - Prioritize security efforts based on risk

3. **Holistic Approach**
   - Assess both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems
   - Consider interdependencies between systems
   - Evaluate systems not specifically listed in Facility Security Plans (FSPs)

---

## 4. Regulatory Guidance and Requirements

### U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 01-20

NVIC 01-20 provides guidelines for addressing cyber risks at MTSA-regulated facilities:

- **Facility Security Assessment (FSA)**: Must assess and document vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks
- **Facility Security Plan (FSP)**: Must address identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Alternative Security Program (ASP)**: Can be used as an alternative to FSP

### Key Requirements

   - Monitor for new threats and vulnerabilities
   - Update cybersecurity plans accordingly

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating if an asset is critical, ask:

1. If this asset were compromised, could it lead to:
   - Significant loss of life?
   - Environmental damage?
   - Transportation system disruption?
   - Economic disruption in a particular area?

2. Is this asset:
   - Essential to maritime operations?
   - Connected to systems managing physical processes?
   - Required for safety or security functions?
   - Critical to preventing or responding to incidents?

3. What is the asset's:
   - Role in critical processes?
   - Interdependency with other systems?
   - Potential impact if compromised?

---

## 8. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Including too many assets as "critical" dilutes focus and resources.

**Solution**: 
- Strictly apply the TSI definition
- Focus on assets whose compromise could directly or indirectly lead to a TSI
- Use risk-based prioritization

### Challenge: IT vs. OT Distinction

**Problem**: Uncertainty about which IT systems are in scope.

**Solution**:
- Evaluate IT systems based on their connection to maritime operations
- Consider IT systems that support or control OT systems
- Assess IT systems that handle data critical to preventing TSIs

### Challenge: Interdependencies

**Problem**: Difficulty identifying indirect pathways to TSI.

**Solution**:
- Map system interdependencies
- Consider cascading failure scenarios
- Assess both direct and indirect impacts

---

## 9. Foreign-Located Systems and Geographic Scope

### Key Principle: Location Does Not Determine Criticality

**Important**: The geographic location of a system (whether domestic or foreign) does **NOT** inherently exclude it from being considered a critical asset under MTSA. The determining factor is the **operational impact** on U.S. maritime operations and the system's potential to contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI).

### Example: Foreign-Located Logistics Systems (e.g., SAP)

For systems like SAP logistics platforms hosted in another country, consider the following:

#### Assessment Criteria

1. **Operational Impact on U.S. Maritime Operations**
   - Is the system integral to managing logistics that directly affect U.S. maritime facilities?
   - Would a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
   - Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?

2. **Potential to Contribute to a TSI**
   - Could a compromise lead to:
     - Mismanagement of hazardous materials?
     - Significant delays affecting transportation system disruption?
     - Errors in cargo documentation affecting safety?
     - Disruption of critical supply chains?

3. **Interdependencies**
   - Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
   - Would failure cascade to other critical systems?
   - Are U.S. operations dependent on this system for critical functions?

#### Regulatory Perspective

- **MTSA Focus**: The regulation focuses on **impact** on U.S. maritime transportation security, not the physical location of systems
- **Jurisdictional Scope**: While MTSA primarily addresses operations within U.S. jurisdiction, systems that substantially affect U.S. maritime security fall within scope
- **Risk-Based Approach**: The assessment should evaluate the system's role in maintaining security and compliance at U.S. facilities

### Recommendations for Foreign-Located Systems

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate the SAP system's role in U.S. maritime operations
   - Assess potential consequences of disruptions on facility operations
   - Consider both direct and indirect pathways to TSI

2. **Document Interdependencies**
   - Map how the foreign system connects to U.S. facility operations
   - Identify critical data flows and dependencies
   - Document backup and contingency capabilities

3. **Assess Security Posture**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity measures protecting the foreign system
   - Consider data transmission security between countries
   - Review compliance with both U.S. and international standards
   - Assess access controls and monitoring capabilities

4. **Develop Contingency Plans**
   - Plan for scenarios where the foreign system is unavailable
   - Establish alternative processes to maintain operations
   - Test backup and recovery procedures

5. **Consult with Regulatory Authorities**
   - Engage with U.S. Coast Guard to clarify specific requirements
   - Discuss how foreign systems should be addressed in FSP/ASP
   - Seek guidance on documentation and security measure requirements

### Practical Considerations

#### If SAP is Critical:

- **Document in FSP/ASP**: Include the system in your Facility Security Plan or Alternative Security Program
- **Assess Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could contribute to a TSI
- **Implement Security Measures**: Apply appropriate security controls, even if the system is managed by a third party
- **Monitor and Report**: Establish procedures to monitor the system and report incidents

#### If SAP is Not Critical:

- **Document Rationale**: Clearly document why the system does not meet critical asset criteria
- **Review Periodically**: Reassess if operational dependencies change
- **Maintain Awareness**: Monitor for changes that could affect criticality

### Key Questions for Foreign Systems

When evaluating a foreign-located system like SAP:

1. **Operational Dependency**
   - Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
   - How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?
   - What manual or alternative processes exist?

2. **TSI Potential**
   - Could a compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
   - Could data breaches affect facility security?

3. **Control and Visibility**
   - What visibility do you have into the system's security?
   - Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
   - How would you detect a compromise?

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Does the system handle data subject to U.S. regulations?
   - Are there cross-border data transfer considerations?
   - How does the foreign location affect incident reporting?

### Conclusion on Foreign Systems

**Bottom Line**: A foreign-located logistics system like SAP **can be** a critical asset under MTSA if:
- It is integral to U.S. maritime operations
- Its compromise could lead to a Transportation Security Incident
- It is required for critical functions at U.S. facilities

The location itself is not a determining factor—the **impact on U.S. operations and potential to cause a TSI** are what matter.

## 10. Limiting Cyber Scope Through Network Segmentation and Logical Isolation

### The Challenge: Cyber Extends Beyond Physical Boundaries

Unlike physical security where you can isolate shipping operations with fences and access controls, **cybersecurity extends beyond the physical fenceline**. Network connections, data flows, and system interdependencies can create pathways that extend cyber scope far beyond the physical boundaries of shipping operations.

### The Parallel: Physical vs. Cyber Isolation

**Physical Isolation (TWIC Example):**
- You've successfully isolated shipping operations physically
- Only personnel accessing secure areas need TWICs
- Coast Guard accepted this approach for physical access control
- Clear physical boundaries (fences, gates, access points)

**Cyber Isolation Challenge:**
- Networks often span entire facilities
- Systems may be interconnected across business units
- Data flows may not respect physical boundaries
- Cyber threats can propagate through network connections

### Key Principle: Demonstrate No TSI Pathway

Similar to physical isolation, you can limit cyber scope by **demonstrating that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**. The key is proving logical isolation and lack of operational dependency.

### Strategies for Limiting Cyber Scope

#### 1. Network Segmentation and Air-Gapping

**Concept**: Create isolated network segments for shipping operations, separated from general business networks.

**Implementation**:
- **Dedicated Network Infrastructure**: Separate switches, routers, and network equipment for shipping operations
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Physically isolated networks with no connections to non-shipping systems
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Logical separation using Virtual LANs with strict access controls
- **Network Zones**: Create distinct security zones (shipping operations zone vs. general business zone)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Network diagrams showing clear separation
- Access control lists (ACLs) demonstrating isolation
- Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot access shipping networks
- Procedures for managing any necessary data transfers

#### 2. Logical Isolation Through Access Controls

**Concept**: Use logical controls to prevent non-shipping systems from accessing or affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall policies blocking access between zones
- **Access Control Lists**: Network-level restrictions preventing cross-zone communication
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Separate identity management for shipping vs. general systems
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized connections

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Firewall rule documentation
- Access control policies
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Evidence of effective enforcement

#### 3. Operational Dependency Analysis

**Concept**: Demonstrate that non-shipping systems are not operationally required for shipping functions.

**Key Questions**:
- Can shipping operations function independently if non-shipping systems fail?
- Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems without affecting shipping?
- Are there redundant systems within the shipping network that eliminate dependency?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Business continuity plans showing independence
- Manual process documentation
- Dependency mapping showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Test results demonstrating operational independence

#### 4. Data Flow Analysis and Restrictions

**Concept**: Map and restrict data flows to prevent non-shipping data from affecting shipping operations.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Document all data flows between systems
- **One-Way Data Transfers**: Use unidirectional data diodes where possible
- **Data Filtering**: Filter out non-essential data from shipping networks
- **Read-Only Access**: Limit non-shipping systems to read-only access where data sharing is necessary

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Data flow diagrams
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Evidence that non-shipping data cannot affect shipping operations
- Procedures for any necessary data exchanges

#### 5. System Architecture Documentation

**Concept**: Clearly document system architecture to demonstrate separation and isolation.

**Documentation Should Include**:
- Network topology diagrams showing isolated segments
- System inventory clearly categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping systems
- Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths through non-shipping systems
- Security control documentation for each network zone
- Change management procedures ensuring isolation is maintained

### Coast Guard Considerations

When proposing cyber scope limitations, consider:

1. **Demonstrable Isolation**: Can you prove that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a TSI?
2. **Operational Independence**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
3. **No Critical Dependencies**: Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
4. **Effective Controls**: Are isolation controls effectively implemented and monitored?
5. **Documentation**: Is the isolation strategy clearly documented in your FSP?

### Practical Implementation Approach

#### Step 1: Network Architecture Assessment
- Map current network topology
- Identify all systems and their connections
- Categorize systems as shipping-critical vs. non-shipping
- Identify any interdependencies

#### Step 2: Design Isolation Strategy
- Design network segmentation approach
- Plan logical isolation controls
- Identify required changes to network infrastructure
- Plan for any necessary data exchange mechanisms

#### Step 3: Implement Isolation
- Deploy network segmentation
- Implement access controls
- Configure firewalls and network security
- Establish monitoring and alerting

#### Step 4: Validate Isolation
- Test operational independence
- Verify no unauthorized connections
- Validate that non-shipping system failures don't affect shipping
- Document test results

#### Step 5: Document in FSP
- Document network architecture and isolation strategy
- Include network diagrams and system inventories
- Document security controls and monitoring procedures
- Explain how isolation limits cyber scope
- Submit to Coast Guard for review

### Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined network boundaries between shipping and non-shipping systems
2. **Proven Independence**: Demonstrable operational independence of shipping systems
3. **Effective Controls**: Technical controls that actually prevent unauthorized access
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to ensure isolation is maintained
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation supporting the scope limitation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Legacy Systems**: Older systems may have undocumented connections
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure (e.g., domain controllers, DNS) may create dependencies
3. **Third-Party Systems**: Vendor systems may have unexpected connections
4. **Data Requirements**: Business needs may require data sharing that creates dependencies
5. **Change Management**: Maintaining isolation as systems evolve

### Recommendations

1. **Start with Assessment**: Thoroughly assess current network architecture and dependencies
2. **Design Before Implementing**: Plan isolation strategy carefully before making changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate isolation through testing before claiming scope limitation
4. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical for Coast Guard acceptance
5. **Engage Coast Guard Early**: Discuss your approach with Coast Guard before finalizing
6. **Plan for Exceptions**: Identify and document any necessary exceptions and their security controls
7. **Maintain Isolation**: Establish procedures to maintain isolation over time

### Important Conflict: Segmentation vs. Foreign-Located Systems

**The Conflict**: There is a logical inconsistency that needs to be addressed:

- **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations
- **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP logistics) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical assets
- **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
- **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are **separate issues**:
- **Segmentation** limits facility-level scope (proving non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping)
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway, not location
- If a foreign system (like SAP) is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Its location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

**The Critical Question**: Can shipping operations function without the foreign system?
- **If No** → System is critical and in scope regardless of location or segmentation
- **If Yes** → System may not be critical

**"Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation**: Research indicates that "transportation system disruption" refers to **disruption of trade/commerce and regional economy**, not individual company operations. This interpretation can help resolve the conflict:

- **If foreign systems only affect company operations** (not trade/commerce) → May not be in scope
- **If foreign systems affect trade/commerce** → Are critical regardless of location
- **Segmentation can limit scope** if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce

**Key Insight**: The focus should be on **trade/commerce impact**, not company profitability.

**Recommendations**: 
- See `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework
- See `TSI_Transportation_Disruption_Analysis.md` for comprehensive exploration of the conflict

### Conclusion on Cyber Scope Limitation

**Bottom Line**: You can limit the scope of critical cyber assets under MTSA by:

1. **Demonstrating Logical Isolation**: Proving that non-shipping systems cannot access or affect shipping operations
2. **Proving Operational Independence**: Showing that shipping operations can function without non-shipping systems
3. **Implementing Effective Controls**: Using network segmentation, access controls, and monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Documenting the isolation strategy in your FSP

The key is **proving that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**, similar to how physical isolation proves that non-shipping areas don't require TWIC access.

**Important Limitations**:
- Facility-level segmentation addresses facility systems, not foreign-located systems
- Foreign systems are assessed separately based on operational dependency
- The "transportation system disruption" component of TSI needs clarification
- **Engage with Coast Guard** to clarify TSI interpretation and scope before finalizing approach

---

## 11. Conclusion

Defining critical assets under MTSA requires a systematic, risk-based approach that focuses on preventing Transportation Security Incidents. Key takeaways:

1. **Critical assets** are those whose compromise could lead to a TSI
2. **TSI scope** is clearly defined: significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption
3. **Industry practices** emphasize structured classification and risk-based assessment
4. **Regulatory guidance** is available through NVIC 01-20 and Coast Guard resources

# TSI Interpretation: Trade/Commerce Impact vs. Company Profitability

## Key Finding: TSI Focuses on Trade and Commerce, Not Company Profitability

Research indicates that the **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** definition focuses on **broader impacts on trade, commerce, regional economies, and public welfare**, rather than on **individual company profitability**.

This distinction is crucial for understanding what systems are truly "critical" under MTSA.

---

## TSI Definition Review

A **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, **transportation system disruption**, or **economic disruption in a particular area**."

### Key Interpretive Points

1. **"Transportation System Disruption"** focuses on:
   - Disruption of maritime trade and commerce
   - Disruption of port operations
   - Disruption of supply chains affecting multiple entities
   - Disruption of the movement of goods and people
   - **NOT** disruption of individual company operations

2. **"Economic Disruption in a Particular Area"** focuses on:
   - Regional economic stability
   - Trade and commerce impacts
   - Effects on multiple businesses and consumers
   - Broader economic consequences
   - **NOT** individual company profitability

3. **"Particular Area"** refers to:
   - Geographic region (port area, maritime region, etc.)
   - Regional economy
   - Trade/commerce network
   - **NOT** individual facility operations

---

## Implications for Critical Asset Assessment

### What IS In Scope (Trade/Commerce Impact)

Systems whose compromise could lead to:

1. **Disruption of Maritime Trade/Commerce**
   - Port operations shutdown
   - Vessel traffic disruption
   - Cargo handling disruption affecting multiple entities
   - Supply chain disruption affecting regional commerce

2. **Disruption of Transportation Infrastructure**
   - Port facilities
   - Shipping channels
   - Cargo terminals
   - Vessel operations

3. **Regional Economic Impact**
   - Effects on multiple businesses
   - Consumer impacts
   - Regional economic stability
   - Trade flow disruption

4. **Public Safety and Environmental Impact**
   - Significant loss of life
   - Environmental damage
   - Public health impacts

### What MAY NOT Be In Scope (Company-Specific Impact)

Systems whose compromise would only affect:

1. **Individual Company Operations**
   - Internal business processes
   - Company-specific logistics
   - Internal operations not affecting trade/commerce

2. **Company Profitability**
   - Financial performance
   - Company-specific economic impacts
   - Internal business disruption

3. **Non-Trade Operations**
   - Systems supporting non-maritime operations
   - General business systems not affecting shipping
   - Systems that don't impact trade/commerce

---

## Application to Your Situation

### Foreign-Located SAP Logistics System

**Key Questions**:

1. **Does SAP disruption affect trade/commerce or just your company?**
   - If SAP disruption only affects your company's operations → May not be in scope
   - If SAP disruption affects port operations, vessel scheduling, or cargo movement affecting multiple entities → Likely in scope

2. **Does SAP disruption affect regional commerce?**
   - If disruption only impacts your company's profitability → May not be in scope
   - If disruption impacts regional trade, port operations, or supply chains → Likely in scope

3. **Is SAP required for maritime trade operations?**
   - If SAP is only used for internal logistics/accounting → May not be in scope
   - If SAP is required for vessel operations, cargo handling, or port operations → Likely in scope

### Network Segmentation

**Key Insight**: If you can demonstrate that:

1. **Non-shipping systems only affect company operations** (not trade/commerce)
2. **Non-shipping systems don't impact regional commerce**
3. **Non-shipping systems don't affect port/maritime operations**

Then segmentation may effectively limit scope, because these systems wouldn't cause "transportation system disruption" or "economic disruption in a particular area" as defined by MTSA.

---

## Assessment Framework: Trade/Commerce vs. Company Impact

### Step 1: Identify Trade/Commerce Impact

For each system, assess:

1. **Does system compromise affect port operations?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Does system compromise affect vessel operations?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

3. **Does system compromise affect cargo handling for multiple entities?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

4. **Does system compromise affect regional supply chains?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → Continue assessment

5. **Does system compromise affect regional trade/commerce?**
   - Yes → Likely in scope
   - No → May not be in scope

### Step 2: Identify Company-Specific Impact

For each system, assess:

1. **Does system compromise only affect your company's operations?**
   - Yes → May not be in scope (if no trade/commerce impact)
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Does system compromise only affect your company's profitability?**
   - Yes → May not be in scope (if no trade/commerce impact)
   - No → Continue assessment

3. **Does system compromise only affect internal business processes?**
   - Yes → May not be in scope (if no trade/commerce impact)
   - No → Continue assessment

### Step 3: Determine Criticality

**Critical if**:
- System compromise could cause trade/commerce disruption
- System compromise could affect regional economy
- System compromise could disrupt port/maritime operations
- System compromise could affect multiple entities

**May Not Be Critical if**:
- System compromise only affects individual company operations
- System compromise only affects company profitability
- System compromise doesn't impact trade/commerce
- System compromise doesn't affect regional economy

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Vessel Traffic Management System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects all vessels in port area
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: Yes - affects port operations and trade
- **Company Impact**: Yes, but broader than company-specific
- **Criticality**: **CRITICAL** - affects trade/commerce

### Example 2: Cargo Handling System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects cargo movement at facility
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: Yes - affects cargo flow and trade
- **Company Impact**: Yes, but affects trade/commerce
- **Criticality**: **CRITICAL** - affects trade/commerce

### Example 3: Internal Accounting System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects company financial operations
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: No - only affects company
- **Company Impact**: Yes - but only company-specific
- **Criticality**: **MAY NOT BE CRITICAL** - no trade/commerce impact

### Example 4: SAP Logistics System (Foreign-Located)
- **Impact**: Depends on function
  - If used for vessel scheduling affecting port operations → **CRITICAL**
  - If used for cargo tracking affecting trade → **CRITICAL**
  - If used only for internal logistics/accounting → **MAY NOT BE CRITICAL**

### Example 5: HR System
- **Impact**: Disruption affects company HR operations
- **Trade/Commerce Impact**: No - only affects company
- **Company Impact**: Yes - but only company-specific
- **Criticality**: **MAY NOT BE CRITICAL** - no trade/commerce impact

---

## Resolving the Segmentation Conflict

### The Conflict Revisited

**Original Conflict**:
- Facility-level segmentation can isolate shipping operations
- Foreign systems (like SAP) could cause "transportation system disruption"
- Segmentation doesn't prevent foreign system compromise from causing disruption

### Resolution with Trade/Commerce Focus

**New Understanding**:
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of trade/commerce, not company operations
- If SAP only affects company operations (not trade/commerce), it may not be critical
- If SAP affects trade/commerce, it's critical regardless of location or segmentation

**Key Questions**:
1. **Does SAP disruption affect trade/commerce?**
   - If no → SAP may not be critical, segmentation can limit scope
   - If yes → SAP is critical, but segmentation may still limit scope of other systems

2. **Can you operate shipping without SAP affecting trade/commerce?**
   - If yes → SAP may not be critical
   - If no → SAP is critical

3. **Does SAP affect port operations, vessel operations, or cargo handling?**
   - If yes → SAP is critical
   - If no → SAP may not be critical

---

## Practical Application

### For Your SAP System

**Assessment Questions**:

1. **What is SAP's role in shipping operations?**
   - Vessel scheduling?
   - Cargo tracking?
   - Port operations?
   - Internal logistics only?

2. **If SAP is compromised, what is the impact?**
   - Port operations disruption?
   - Vessel operations disruption?
   - Cargo handling disruption affecting trade?
   - Only company operations disruption?

3. **Does SAP disruption affect multiple entities?**
   - Port operators?
   - Other shipping companies?
   - Regional trade/commerce?
   - Only your company?

### For Network Segmentation

**Assessment Questions**:

1. **Do non-shipping systems affect trade/commerce?**
   - If no → Segmentation may effectively limit scope
   - If yes → Systems are critical regardless of segmentation

2. **Can non-shipping systems cause "transportation system disruption"?**
   - If no → May not be in scope
   - If yes → Are critical

3. **Do non-shipping systems affect regional economy?**
   - If no → May not be in scope
   - If yes → Are critical

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Reframe Assessment Focus

Shift from "company operations impact" to **"trade/commerce impact"**:
- Assess whether systems affect trade/commerce
- Assess whether systems affect regional economy
- Assess whether systems affect port/maritime operations
- **NOT** whether systems affect company profitability

### 2. Document Trade/Commerce Analysis

For each system, document:
- Trade/commerce impact assessment
- Regional economic impact assessment
- Port/maritime operations impact assessment
- Company-specific impact (for comparison)

### 3. Engage Coast Guard with Trade/Commerce Focus

When engaging with Coast Guard, emphasize:
- Your understanding that TSI focuses on trade/commerce
- Your assessment of trade/commerce impacts
- Your identification of systems affecting trade/commerce vs. company operations
- Your proposed scope limitation based on trade/commerce impact

### 4. Use Segmentation Strategically

Segmentation can limit scope if you can demonstrate:
- Non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
- Non-shipping systems don't affect regional economy
- Non-shipping systems don't affect port/maritime operations
- Only shipping systems affect trade/commerce

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **TSI focuses on trade/commerce, not company profitability**
   - "Transportation system disruption" = trade/commerce disruption
   - "Economic disruption in particular area" = regional economic impact
   - Individual company impacts may not be in scope

2. **Critical assets are those affecting trade/commerce**
   - Systems affecting port operations
   - Systems affecting vessel operations
   - Systems affecting cargo handling and trade
   - Systems affecting regional commerce

3. **Company-specific systems may not be critical**
   - Internal business systems
   - Company-specific logistics
   - Systems only affecting company profitability
   - Systems not affecting trade/commerce

4. **Segmentation can limit scope if properly applied**
   - If non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
   - If segmentation prevents trade/commerce impact
   - If shipping systems are isolated from non-shipping systems

5. **Foreign systems assessed by trade/commerce impact**
   - If foreign system affects trade/commerce → Critical
   - If foreign system only affects company operations → May not be critical
   - Location is less relevant than trade/commerce impact

---

## Questions for Coast Guard Engagement

When engaging with Coast Guard, consider asking:

1. **TSI Interpretation**
   - Does "transportation system disruption" refer to trade/commerce disruption?
   - Does "economic disruption in particular area" refer to regional economic impact?
   - Are company-specific impacts (not affecting trade/commerce) in scope?

2. **Critical Asset Scope**
   - Are systems that only affect company operations (not trade/commerce) in scope?
   - Are systems that only affect company profitability in scope?
   - What is the threshold for trade/commerce impact?

3. **Segmentation and Scope Limitation**
   - Can segmentation limit scope if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce?
   - How do we demonstrate that systems don't affect trade/commerce?
   - What level of isolation is required?

4. **Foreign Systems**
   - How are foreign systems assessed for trade/commerce impact?
   - Are foreign systems that only affect company operations in scope?
   - What is the assessment approach for foreign systems?

---

## Conclusion

The distinction between **trade/commerce impact** and **company profitability** is crucial for understanding MTSA scope:

- **TSI focuses on trade/commerce, regional economy, and public welfare**
- **Company-specific impacts may not be in scope**
- **Critical assets are those affecting trade/commerce**
- **Segmentation can limit scope if properly applied**
- **Foreign systems assessed by trade/commerce impact, not location**

This interpretation can help resolve the conflict between segmentation and foreign systems by focusing on the **actual impact on trade/commerce** rather than company operations.

**Next Steps**:
1. Reframe your critical asset assessment using trade/commerce focus
2. Assess SAP and other systems for trade/commerce impact
3. Document your analysis clearly
4. Engage with Coast Guard using trade/commerce framework
5. Seek approval for scope limitation based on trade/commerce impact

# Understanding the "Transportation System Disruption" Conflict

## The Core Conflict

You've identified a critical logical inconsistency:

1. **Network segmentation** can isolate shipping operations from non-shipping operations at the facility level
2. **Foreign-located logistics systems** (like SAP) could cause "transportation system disruption" if compromised
3. **Facility-level segmentation** doesn't prevent disruption if the foreign system itself is compromised
4. **Question**: How can segmentation limit scope if foreign systems can still cause TSI regardless of facility segmentation?

This document explores this conflict and seeks to clarify the interpretation of "transportation system disruption" in the TSI definition.

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: Research indicates that "transportation system disruption" refers to **disruption of trade/commerce and regional economy**, not individual company operations. This interpretation may help resolve the conflict. See `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis.

---

## TSI Definition Review

A **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)** is defined as:
> "A security incident resulting in significant loss of life, environmental damage, **transportation system disruption**, or economic disruption in a **particular area**."

### Key Questions for Interpretation

1. **What is "transportation system disruption"?**
   - Disruption of the facility's shipping operations?
   - Disruption of the broader maritime transportation network?
   - Disruption of regional/national transportation infrastructure?
   - Any disruption affecting transportation services?

2. **What is "particular area"?**
   - The facility itself?
   - The local port/maritime area?
   - A regional transportation network?
   - A geographic region?

3. **What is the "could lead to" standard?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways through cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway, no matter how remote?

---

## The Segmentation vs. Foreign System Conflict

### Scenario Analysis

#### Scenario 1: Facility-Level Segmentation
- **Setup**: Shipping operations network is isolated from general business network
- **Assumption**: Non-shipping systems cannot access shipping systems
- **Question**: Does this mean non-shipping systems are out of scope?

#### Scenario 2: Foreign-Located Critical System
- **Setup**: SAP logistics system is located in another country
- **Function**: Manages logistics, cargo tracking, vessel scheduling
- **Impact if Compromised**: Could disrupt shipping operations, causing transportation system disruption
- **Question**: Is SAP in scope even though it's foreign-located?

#### The Conflict
- If SAP can cause "transportation system disruption" (a TSI component), it's likely a critical asset
- Facility-level segmentation doesn't prevent SAP from being compromised
- Facility-level segmentation doesn't prevent SAP compromise from causing disruption
- **Therefore**: How does segmentation help limit scope if foreign systems are still in scope?

---

## Research Findings: "Transportation System Disruption"

### Regulatory Text Search

**33 CFR 101.105** defines TSI, but specific interpretation of "transportation system disruption" is not detailed in readily available public sources.

### Key Interpretive Questions

1. **Scope of "Transportation System"**
   - **Narrow Interpretation**: The facility's transportation operations only
   - **Broad Interpretation**: The broader maritime transportation network/port area
   - **Very Broad**: Regional or national transportation infrastructure

2. **Scope of "Disruption"**
   - **Minimal**: Any interruption of normal operations
   - **Moderate**: Significant operational impact
   - **Severe**: Complete shutdown or major failure

3. **Scope of "Particular Area"**
   - **Facility**: The MTSA-regulated facility itself
   - **Port Area**: The port/maritime area where the facility operates
   - **Regional**: A broader geographic region affected by the disruption

### Potential Interpretations

#### Interpretation A: Facility-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the facility's shipping operations
- "Particular area" = the facility or immediate port area
- **Implication**: If you can segment and prove non-shipping systems can't disrupt shipping operations, they may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system is required for shipping operations, it's in scope regardless of location

#### Interpretation B: Network-Centric
- "Transportation system disruption" = disruption of the broader maritime transportation network
- "Particular area" = the port/maritime area or regional network
- **Implication**: Any system that could disrupt the broader network is in scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If foreign system could affect the broader network, it's in scope

#### Interpretation C: Impact-Based
- "Transportation system disruption" = any disruption that affects transportation services in a particular area
- "Particular area" = defined by the impact, not geography
- **Implication**: Focus on impact, not location or direct connection
- **Foreign Systems**: If impact could reach transportation services, it's in scope

## The "Could Lead To" Standard

### Critical Asset Definition

Critical assets are those **"whose compromise could lead to a TSI"**.

### Key Questions

1. **What does "could lead to" mean?**
   - Direct causation only?
   - Indirect pathways?
   - Cascading failures?
   - Any potential pathway?

2. **How remote can the pathway be?**
   - Must be direct and immediate?
   - Can include indirect dependencies?
   - Can include multiple steps?

3. **What is the burden of proof?**
   - Must prove it could happen?
   - Must prove it's likely?
   - Must prove there's no pathway?

### Potential Standards

#### Standard 1: Direct Causation
- Asset compromise must directly cause TSI
- No intermediate steps
- **Example**: Compromise of vessel traffic system directly causes collision

#### Standard 2: Reasonable Pathway
- Asset compromise must have a reasonable pathway to TSI
- Can include intermediate steps if logical
- **Example**: Compromise of logistics system → incorrect cargo manifests → safety incident

#### Standard 3: Any Potential Pathway
- Asset compromise must have any potential pathway to TSI, no matter how remote
- Includes theoretical possibilities
- **Example**: Any system that could theoretically affect operations

---

## Reconciling the Conflict: Potential Approaches

### Approach 1: Distinguish Between Direct and Indirect Support

**Concept**: Distinguish between systems that "directly support" shipping operations vs. those that "indirectly support" or "could theoretically affect" operations.

**Application**:
- **Direct Support**: Systems required for shipping operations to function
  - Vessel traffic management
  - Cargo handling systems
  - Loading/unloading controls
  - **Foreign Systems**: If SAP is required for shipping operations, it directly supports them
  
- **Indirect Support**: Systems that support business operations but aren't required for shipping
  - General business systems
  - HR systems
  - Finance systems (unless required for shipping)
  - **Segmentation**: If properly isolated, these may be out of scope

**Key Question**: Can you operate shipping without SAP? If no, SAP directly supports shipping and is in scope regardless of location.

### Approach 2: Focus on Operational Independence

**Concept**: If shipping operations can function independently of non-shipping systems, those systems may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if non-shipping systems fail?
- **If Yes**: Non-shipping systems may be out of scope (with proper segmentation)
- **If No**: Non-shipping systems are in scope

**Foreign Systems**:
- **Test**: Can shipping operations continue if SAP fails?
- **If Yes**: SAP may not be critical (unlikely for logistics system)
- **If No**: SAP is critical and in scope

**Segmentation Role**: Segmentation helps prove operational independence by preventing non-shipping systems from affecting shipping systems.

### Approach 3: Distinguish Between System Location and System Function

**Concept**: The location of a system (foreign vs. domestic) is separate from whether it's critical. Segmentation addresses facility-level scope, not foreign system criticality.

**Application**:
- **Facility-Level Segmentation**: Limits scope of facility systems
  - Isolates shipping operations from non-shipping operations
  - Proves non-shipping facility systems can't affect shipping
  
- **Foreign System Assessment**: Separate assessment of foreign systems
  - If foreign system is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of location
  - Segmentation doesn't change foreign system criticality
  - But segmentation may prevent foreign system compromise from affecting non-shipping facility systems

**Key Insight**: Segmentation and foreign system criticality are separate issues:
- Segmentation limits **facility-level** scope
- Foreign system criticality is determined by **operational dependency**, not location

### Approach 4: Focus on "Particular Area" Interpretation

**Concept**: If "particular area" means the facility or immediate port area, then systems that only affect broader operations may be out of scope.

**Application**:
- **Facility/Port Area Impact**: Systems that could disrupt facility/port operations are in scope
- **Broader Impact Only**: Systems that only affect broader operations (not facility/port) may be out of scope
- **Foreign Systems**: If SAP disruption only affects broader logistics (not facility operations), may be out of scope

**Challenge**: This interpretation may be too narrow and may not align with Coast Guard expectations.

---

## Recommended Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Assess Operational Dependency

For each system (facility or foreign):

1. **Is the system required for shipping operations to function?**
   - Yes → Likely critical
   - No → Continue assessment

2. **Can shipping operations continue if this system fails?**
   - No → Likely critical
   - Yes → May not be critical

3. **What is the maximum acceptable downtime?**
   - Minutes/hours → Likely critical
   - Days/weeks → May not be critical

### Step 2: Assess TSI Pathway

For each system:

1. **Direct Pathway**: Can system compromise directly cause TSI?
   - Example: Vessel traffic system → collision
   - If yes → Critical

2. **Indirect Pathway**: Can system compromise lead to TSI through intermediate steps?
   - Example: Logistics system → incorrect cargo → safety incident
   - Assess reasonableness of pathway

3. **Cascading Failure**: Could system failure cascade to critical systems?
   - Assess interdependencies
   - Evaluate segmentation effectiveness

### Step 3: Assess Segmentation Effectiveness

For facility-level systems:

1. **Can segmentation prevent access to shipping systems?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

2. **Can segmentation prevent impact on shipping operations?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

3. **Is operational independence proven?**
   - Yes → May limit scope
   - No → System is in scope

### Step 4: Assess Foreign Systems Separately

For foreign-located systems:

1. **Operational Dependency**: Is system required for shipping?
   - Yes → Likely critical regardless of location
   - No → May not be critical

2. **TSI Pathway**: Can compromise cause transportation system disruption?
   - Yes → Critical
   - No → May not be critical

3. **Segmentation Role**: Can facility segmentation prevent foreign system from affecting non-shipping systems?
   - Yes → Segmentation helps limit scope of impact
   - No → Foreign system affects entire facility scope

---

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Insight 1: Segmentation and Foreign Systems Are Separate Issues

- **Segmentation** addresses facility-level scope limitation
- **Foreign system criticality** is determined by operational dependency and TSI pathway
- Segmentation doesn't change whether a foreign system is critical
- But segmentation may limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise

### Insight 2: The "Transportation System Disruption" Question Needs Clarification

- The regulatory definition is not specific
- Interpretation may vary
- **Recommendation**: Engage with Coast Guard to clarify:
  - What constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
  - What is the scope of "particular area"?
  - What is the "could lead to" standard?

### Insight 3: Operational Dependency Is Key

- If SAP is required for shipping operations, it's likely critical regardless of:
  - Location (foreign vs. domestic)
  - Facility-level segmentation
  - Network architecture

- The question is: **Can shipping operations function without SAP?**
  - If no → SAP is critical
  - If yes → SAP may not be critical

### Insight 4: Segmentation May Still Have Value

Even if foreign systems are critical, facility-level segmentation may:
- Limit the scope of systems affected by foreign system compromise
- Prevent non-shipping systems from being affected
- Demonstrate operational independence of shipping operations
- Reduce overall risk surface

### Insight 5: The Conflict May Be Unresolvable Without Regulatory Clarification

The logical conflict you've identified suggests that:
- Either "transportation system disruption" has a narrower interpretation than assumed
- Or foreign systems that could cause disruption are in scope regardless of segmentation
- Or there's a distinction between "direct support" and "indirect support" that needs clarification

---

## Questions for Coast Guard Engagement

When engaging with the Coast Guard, consider asking:

1. **TSI Definition Clarification**
   - What specifically constitutes "transportation system disruption"?
   - What is the scope of "particular area"?
   - Are there examples or case studies of what constitutes a TSI?

2. **Critical Asset Scope**
   - What is the "could lead to" standard?
   - Must the pathway be direct, or can it be indirect?
   - How remote can the pathway be?

3. **Foreign Systems**
   - How are foreign-located systems assessed?
   - Does location affect criticality assessment?
   - How do foreign systems fit into facility security plans?

4. **Segmentation and Scope Limitation**
   - Can network segmentation limit the scope of critical assets?
   - What level of isolation is required?
   - How is operational independence demonstrated?

5. **Operational Dependency**
   - How is "required for operations" defined?
   - What is the threshold for operational dependency?
   - How is acceptable downtime determined?

---

## Conclusion

The conflict you've identified is real and important:

1. **Facility-level segmentation** can isolate shipping from non-shipping operations
2. **Foreign-located systems** (like SAP) that could cause "transportation system disruption" are likely critical
3. **Segmentation doesn't prevent** foreign system compromise from causing disruption
4. **Therefore**: There's a logical inconsistency that needs resolution

**IMPORTANT RESOLUTION PATH**: Research indicates that "transportation system disruption" focuses on **trade/commerce impact**, not company operations. This means:
- If foreign systems only affect company operations (not trade/commerce) → May not be in scope
- If foreign systems affect trade/commerce → Are critical regardless of location
- Segmentation can limit scope if non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce

**See `TSI_Trade_Commerce_Interpretation.md` for detailed analysis and assessment framework.**

**Potential Resolutions**:

1. **Narrow TSI Interpretation**: "Transportation system disruption" may have a narrower scope than assumed
2. **Operational Dependency Focus**: If SAP is required for shipping, it's critical regardless of segmentation
3. **Separate Assessments**: Segmentation limits facility scope; foreign systems assessed separately
4. **Regulatory Clarification Needed**: The conflict suggests need for Coast Guard guidance

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. **Engage Coast Guard**: Seek clarification on TSI definition and scope
2. **Assess Operational Dependency**: Determine if SAP is truly required for shipping
3. **Document Analysis**: Clearly document your assessment and reasoning
4. **Propose Approach**: Present your analysis and proposed scope limitation to Coast Guard
5. **Seek Approval**: Get Coast Guard acceptance of your approach before finalizing FSP

The key is to **acknowledge the conflict, analyze it thoroughly, and seek regulatory clarification** rather than assuming one interpretation over another.

# Critical Asset Assessment Checklist for MTSA Compliance

## Quick Reference: Is an Asset Critical?

An asset is **critical** if its compromise could lead to a **Transportation Security Incident (TSI)**:
- ✓ Significant loss of life
- ✓ Environmental damage
- ✓ Transportation system disruption
- ✓ Economic disruption in a particular area

---

## Assessment Checklist

### Phase 1: Asset Inventory

- [ ] Compile comprehensive list of all IT systems
- [ ] Compile comprehensive list of all OT systems
- [ ] Document network diagrams
- [ ] Document existing cybersecurity policies
- [ ] Identify all systems impacting maritime operations
- [ ] Map system interdependencies

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment

For each asset, evaluate:

#### Operational Impact
- [ ] Is this asset essential to maritime operations?
- [ ] Would compromise disrupt critical processes?
- [ ] Is this asset required for safety functions?
- [ ] Is this asset required for security functions?

#### TSI Potential
- [ ] Could compromise lead to significant loss of life?
- [ ] Could compromise lead to environmental damage?
- [ ] Could compromise lead to transportation system disruption?
- [ ] Could compromise lead to economic disruption?

#### System Characteristics
- [ ] Does this asset control or monitor physical processes?
- [ ] Is this asset connected to systems managing COI?
- [ ] Does this asset handle sensitive data?
- [ ] Is this asset critical to preventing incidents?
- [ ] Is this asset critical to responding to incidents?

#### Interdependencies
- [ ] Would failure adversely affect other critical systems?
- [ ] Are other systems dependent on this asset?
- [ ] Could compromise cause cascading failures?

#### Foreign-Located Systems (e.g., Cloud, SaaS, International Systems)
**Note**: Geographic location does NOT exclude systems from being critical. Assess based on impact on U.S. operations.

- [ ] Is the system integral to U.S. maritime facility operations?
- [ ] Could a disruption impact vessel operations, cargo handling, or facility security?
- [ ] Does the system manage data critical to preventing TSIs?
- [ ] Could compromise lead to mismanagement of hazardous materials?
- [ ] Could errors or manipulation lead to safety incidents?
- [ ] Is the system connected to or required by systems at U.S. facilities?
- [ ] What visibility do you have into the system's security?
- [ ] Can you implement security measures or only rely on vendor controls?
- [ ] How would you detect a compromise?
- [ ] What backup and contingency capabilities exist?
- [ ] Can U.S. maritime facilities operate without this system?
- [ ] How long could operations continue if the system were unavailable?

### Phase 3: Classification

Classify each asset as:

- [ ] **Very High Criticality**: Essential to business survival; compromise = catastrophic consequences
- [ ] **High Criticality**: Compromise = significant operational disruption
- [ ] **Medium Criticality**: Important but not vital; moderate impact
- [ ] **Low Criticality**: Minimal impact if compromised

**Note**: Focus on Very High and High criticality assets for TSI prevention.

### Phase 4: Documentation

- [ ] Document asset criticality classification
- [ ] Document rationale for each classification
- [ ] Document identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document potential TSI pathways
- [ ] Update Facility Security Assessment (FSA)
- [ ] Update Facility Security Plan (FSP) or Alternative Security Program (ASP)

### Phase 5: Cybersecurity Plan

- [ ] Address identified vulnerabilities in FSP/ASP
- [ ] Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- [ ] Include measures to protect critical assets
- [ ] Establish incident response procedures
- [ ] Define reporting requirements
- [ ] Set up regular review schedule

---

## Common Critical Asset Categories

### Operational Technology (OT)
- [ ] Process control systems (SCADA, DCS)
- [ ] Safety systems (emergency shutdown, fire suppression)
- [ ] Environmental monitoring systems
- [ ] Vessel traffic management systems
- [ ] Cargo handling systems
- [ ] Loading/unloading systems

### Information Technology (IT)
- [ ] Systems supporting OT operations
- [ ] Security systems (access control, surveillance)
- [ ] Communication systems critical to operations
- [ ] Systems managing COI data
- [ ] Emergency response systems
- [ ] Incident reporting systems
- [ ] **Logistics/ERP systems (e.g., SAP)** - Assess if foreign-located
- [ ] Cloud-based systems supporting operations
- [ ] Third-party managed systems critical to operations

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Network infrastructure supporting critical systems
- [ ] Power systems for critical operations
- [ ] Communication infrastructure
- [ ] Physical security infrastructure

---

## Red Flags: Likely Critical Assets

An asset is likely critical if it:

- ✓ Directly controls physical processes involving chemicals
- ✓ Manages emergency shutdown or safety systems
- ✓ Handles vessel traffic or cargo operations
- ✓ Supports environmental monitoring or response
- ✓ Is required for regulatory compliance reporting
- ✓ Would cause cascading failures if compromised
- ✓ Is identified in your Facility Security Plan
- ✓ **Is integral to logistics/operations even if located outside the U.S.**
- ✓ **Manages data critical to preventing TSIs regardless of location**

---

## Cyber Scope Limitation Assessment

### Network Segmentation and Isolation

If you want to limit cyber scope (similar to physical TWIC isolation), assess:

#### Network Architecture
- [ ] Are shipping operations on a separate network segment?
- [ ] Is there physical or logical isolation from non-shipping systems?
- [ ] Are network boundaries clearly defined and documented?
- [ ] Are firewalls/ACLs preventing unauthorized access between zones?
- [ ] Is network monitoring in place to detect unauthorized connections?

#### Operational Independence
- [ ] Can shipping operations function if non-shipping systems fail?
- [ ] Are there manual or alternative processes that don't require non-shipping systems?
- [ ] What is the maximum acceptable downtime for non-shipping systems?
- [ ] Are there redundant systems within the shipping network?
- [ ] Have you tested operational independence?

#### Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Are there no critical operational dependencies on non-shipping systems?
- [ ] Have you mapped all system interdependencies?
- [ ] Are shared infrastructure components (DNS, domain controllers) isolated?
- [ ] Do third-party systems have unexpected connections?
- [ ] Are data flows restricted and documented?

#### Documentation for FSP
- [ ] Network topology diagrams showing isolation
- [ ] System inventory categorizing shipping vs. non-shipping
- [ ] Interconnection diagrams showing no critical paths
- [ ] Security control documentation for each zone
- [ ] Evidence that non-shipping systems cannot contribute to TSI
- [ ] Change management procedures maintaining isolation

#### Coast Guard Engagement
- [ ] Have you discussed scope limitation approach with Coast Guard?
- [ ] Is your isolation strategy documented in FSP?
- [ ] Can you demonstrate effective isolation controls?
- [ ] Have you validated isolation through testing?

**Key Principle**: To limit scope, you must prove that non-shipping systems **cannot contribute to a Transportation Security Incident**.
