## Research Findings (Verified)

### 4. TSI Focus on Trade/Commerce (Not Company Profitability)

**Finding**: TSI definition focuses on trade/commerce impact, not individual company profitability

**Sources Verified**:
- ✅ CISA: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2019-CSSS-USCG-MTSA-101-508.pdf
- ✅ Cornell Law: https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?def_id=46-USC-802001922-1202936321
- ✅ GovRegs: https://www.govregs.com/regulations/title33_chapterI_part101_subpartA_section101.105

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Multiple authoritative sources confirm TSI focuses on broader impacts (public safety, environment, regional economy) rather than individual company profitability

**Recommendations Based on This Finding**:
- Assess critical assets by trade/commerce impact
- Focus on systems affecting trade/commerce, not company operations
- Use trade/commerce framework for scope limitation

### 5. Foreign-Located Systems Assessment

**Finding**: Geographic location does not determine criticality; assessment based on operational impact

**Sources Verified**:
- ✅ GAO Report: https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/710025.pdf
- ✅ Multiple industry sources confirming location doesn't exclude systems from criticality

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Multiple sources confirm foreign location doesn't exclude systems from being critical assets

**Recommendations Based on This Finding**:
- Assess foreign systems by trade/commerce impact, not location
- Include foreign systems in assessment if affecting trade/commerce
- Document foreign system assessment in Cybersecurity Plan

### 6. Network Segmentation for Scope Limitation

**Finding**: Network segmentation can limit scope similar to physical TWIC isolation

**Sources Verified**:
- ✅ CISA: https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/securing-network-infrastructure-devices
- ✅ NSA: https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/15/2003018261/-1/-1/0/CTR_NSA_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE_SECURITY_GUIDE_20220615.PDF
- ✅ NIST Network Segmentation Guidance

**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED** - Industry best practice and government guidance support network segmentation

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Application to MTSA scope limitation requires Coast Guard confirmation

**Recommendations Based on This Finding**:
- Use network segmentation to isolate shipping operations
- Prove non-shipping systems don't affect trade/commerce
- Document segmentation approach in Cybersecurity Plan
- **Engage Coast Guard** to confirm approach before finalizing

## Recommendations Requiring Coast Guard Confirmation

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Coast Guard Clarification

#### 1. Network Segmentation for Scope Limitation

- **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COAST GUARD CONFIRMATION**
- **Rationale**: Based on logical parallel to physical isolation, but needs regulatory confirmation
- **Sources Supporting Approach**: CISA, NSA network segmentation guidance
- **Action**: Engage Coast Guard before finalizing approach

#### 2. TSI "Transportation System Disruption" Interpretation
- **Recommendation**: Focus on trade/commerce disruption, not company operations
- **Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES COAST GUARD CONFIRMATION**
