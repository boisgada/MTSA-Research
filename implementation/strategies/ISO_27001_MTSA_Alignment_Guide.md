## 1. Alignment Overview

> Version note: This guide assumes ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and Annex A 2022 controls. If you are still on ISO/IEC 27001:2013, map legacy Annex A controls to the 2022 structure before finalizing MTSA alignment.

### 1.1 Core Alignment Areas

ISO 27001 and MTSA share fundamental security principles:

| ISO 27001 Principle | MTSA Requirement | Alignment Level |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Risk-based approach | Cybersecurity Assessment | **High** |
| Access controls | Account security measures | **High** |
| Incident management | Incident reporting and response | **High** |
| Business continuity | Resilience requirements | **High** |
| Continuous improvement | Annual assessments and updates | **High** |
| Security controls | Technical cybersecurity measures | **High** |
| Training and awareness | Cybersecurity training | **Medium** |
| Monitoring and review | Recordkeeping and audits | **High** |

### 1.2 Key Benefits of Leveraging ISO 27001

1. **Established Framework**: ISO 27001 ISMS provides structured approach
2. **Risk Management**: Existing risk assessment processes can be extended
3. **Documentation**: Existing policies and procedures can be referenced
4. **Controls**: Many ISO 27001 controls satisfy MTSA requirements
5. **Audit Trail**: ISO 27001 audit evidence supports MTSA compliance
6. **Continuous Improvement**: ISO 27001 improvement cycle aligns with MTSA

### 1.3 Quick Wins for MTSA Readiness

1. **NRC reporting addendum**: Append NRC contact/escalation steps to the existing incident response runbook and test a desk-check within two weeks.
2. **OT scope statement**: Update the ISO 27001 scope to explicitly include critical OT assets and network segments; log this in the Statement of Applicability.
3. **Drill calendar**: Schedule two MTSA-aligned drills and one full exercise for the next 12 months; align scenarios to maritime operations and TSI impacts.
4. **Access recertification**: Run a privileged-access review for OT/IT systems and capture evidence for the Coast Guard submission packet.
5. **Network zoning proof**: Produce a one-page diagram showing IT/OT segmentation, interconnections, and enforced controls; attach to the MTSA plan.

## 8. Cybersecurity Plan Integration

### 8.1 How to Reference ISO 27001 in Cybersecurity Plan

#### Example Structure:

**Section: Risk Assessment**
> "Our facility conducts comprehensive risk assessments in accordance with ISO 27001 Clause 6.1.2. This risk assessment has been extended to include maritime-specific threats and operational technology (OT) systems as required by MTSA. The assessment methodology follows ISO 27001 principles while addressing MTSA-specific requirements for critical asset identification and Transportation Security Incident (TSI) evaluation."

**Section: Access Controls**
> "Access controls are implemented in accordance with ISO 27001 Annex A.9 (Access Control). These controls include user access management (A.9.2.1), privileged access management (A.9.2.3), and secure log-on procedures (A.9.4.2). All controls have been verified to cover both IT and OT systems, including maritime operations systems."

**Section: Incident Response**
> "Our incident response procedures are established in accordance with ISO 27001 Annex A.5.26 (Response to information security incidents). These procedures have been extended to include immediate reporting to the National Response Center (NRC) as required by MTSA. Maritime-specific incident scenarios are included in our incident response playbooks."
