# MTSA Compliance Strategy: Leveraging Corporate Framework for Multi-Site Efficiency

## Executive Summary

This strategy document provides a **corporate-level approach** to MTSA compliance that leverages your existing mature cybersecurity program (IT/OT), consolidated corporate requirements framework, and best-in-class OT architecture to **minimize duplication** across your four MTSA-regulated sites.

**Key Principle**: Document corporate controls once, reference in site-specific plans, add only site-specific elements.

**Goal**: Achieve MTSA compliance for 4 sites with minimal duplication, leveraging existing corporate cybersecurity investments.
