# Publishing Notes and AI Usage Disclosure

## AI Usage and Provenance

This repository was developed through extensive collaboration with AI assistance. The following details the AI's role and contributions:

### Primary AI Assistant
- **Platform**: Cursor (AI-powered code editor)
- **Assistant**: Auto (agentic AI coding assistant)
- **Approach**: Tool-enabled autonomous agent mode with persistent context and iterative refinement
- **Capabilities**: Research, analysis, drafting, document structuring, web search, code/file operations, and systematic verification

### AI Contributions

**Research and Analysis:**
- Comprehensive regulatory literature scans (33 CFR, USCG Final Rule, NVIC 01-20)
- Cross-sector benchmarking and best practice identification
- Critical asset definition research and TSI interpretation analysis
- Industry alignment research (chemical, water/wastewater, energy, rail, aviation sectors)

**Documentation Development:**
- Drafting of implementation guides, research documents, and strategic frameworks
- Repository structure design and organization
- Documentation framework and template creation
- Systematic content organization and cross-referencing

**Reference Curation:**
- Systematic verification of all recommendations against authoritative sources
- Citation management and reference mapping
- Source validation (USCG, CISA, NIST, ISA, industry standards)
- Documentation of verified references throughout all materials

**Content Quality:**
- Ensuring all content is generic and reusable (no organization-specific references)
- Maintaining consistency across documents
- Enforcing verified references requirement for all recommendations

### Source Material
- **Primary Sources**: Public, authoritative references (USCG Final Rule, NVIC 01-20, CISA/NIST/ISA resources)
- **Industry Sources**: Public industry association guidance and best practices
- **Member-Only Sources**: Noted but not quoted beyond public summaries
- **Verification**: All recommendations linked to verified sources in `VERIFIED_REFERENCES.md`

### Content Assurance
- No proprietary content remains; all content is generic and reusable
- All organization-specific references removed
- All recommendations supported by verified authoritative sources

### AI Platform Credit

This project was developed using **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** (AI-powered code editor) with its **Auto** agentic AI assistant. Cursor's tool-enabled autonomous agent capabilities were essential for:

- **Persistent Context**: Maintaining project context across extended collaboration sessions
- **Multi-Tool Operations**: Simultaneous file operations, web research, and code analysis
- **Iterative Refinement**: Systematic document improvement and verification workflows
- **Autonomous Execution**: Self-directed research, analysis, and content generation with minimal human intervention

The agentic AI approach enabled rapid development of this comprehensive research repository while maintaining rigorous standards for verified references and content quality.

## Do Not Publish (keep internal/private)
- `ai-collaboration/chat_history_*` (session transcripts and internal notes)
- `awesome-copilot/` (third-party repo content; not ours to redistribute)

## Optional/Context to Keep Internal
- Any future session transcripts or scratch pads not intended for public consumption.

## Recommended Pre-Publish Checklist
- Confirm `.gitignore` excludes the paths above.
- Verify all content is generic and reusable (no organization-specific references).
- Verify verified-reference links remain valid.
- Add a license file appropriate for open sharing (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0) if desired.
