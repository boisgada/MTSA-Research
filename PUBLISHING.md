# Publishing Notes and AI Usage Disclosure

## AI Usage and Provenance

This repository was developed through extensive collaboration with AI assistance. The following details the AI's role and contributions:

### Primary AI Assistant
- **Model**: `gpt-5-beast-mode` (tool-enabled, agentic AI)
- **Capabilities**: Research, analysis, drafting, document structuring, and iterative refinement

### AI Contributions

**Research and Analysis:**
- Comprehensive regulatory literature scans (33 CFR, USCG Final Rule, NVIC 01-20)
- Cross-sector benchmarking and best practice identification
- Critical asset definition research and TSI interpretation analysis
- Industry alignment research (chemical, water/wastewater, energy, rail, aviation sectors)

**Documentation Development:**
- Drafting of implementation guides, research documents, and strategic frameworks
- Repository structure design and organization
- Documentation framework and template creation
- Systematic content organization and cross-referencing

**Reference Curation:**
- Systematic verification of all recommendations against authoritative sources
- Citation management and reference mapping
- Source validation (USCG, CISA, NIST, ISA, industry standards)
- Documentation of verified references throughout all materials

**Content Quality:**
- Ensuring all content is generic and reusable (no organization-specific references)
- Maintaining consistency across documents
- Enforcing verified references requirement for all recommendations

### Source Material
- **Primary Sources**: Public, authoritative references (USCG Final Rule, NVIC 01-20, CISA/NIST/ISA resources)
- **Industry Sources**: Public industry association guidance and best practices
- **Member-Only Sources**: Noted but not quoted beyond public summaries
- **Verification**: All recommendations linked to verified sources in `VERIFIED_REFERENCES.md`

### Content Assurance
- No proprietary content remains; all content is generic and reusable
- All organization-specific references removed
- All recommendations supported by verified authoritative sources

## Do Not Publish (keep internal/private)
- `ai-collaboration/chat_history_*` (session transcripts and internal notes)
- `awesome-copilot/` (third-party repo content; not ours to redistribute)

## Optional/Context to Keep Internal
- Any future session transcripts or scratch pads not intended for public consumption.

## Recommended Pre-Publish Checklist
- Confirm `.gitignore` excludes the paths above.
- Verify all content is generic and reusable (no organization-specific references).
- Verify verified-reference links remain valid.
- Add a license file appropriate for open sharing (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0) if desired.
