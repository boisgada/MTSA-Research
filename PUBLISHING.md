# Publishing Notes and AI Usage Disclosure

## AI Usage and Provenance
- Primary assistant: `gpt-5-beast-mode` (tool-enabled, agentic) used for research, drafting, and document updates.
- Activities: literature/regulatory scans, cross-sector benchmarking, verified reference curation, and markdown/document edits.
- Sources: Public, authoritative references (e.g., USCG Final Rule, NVIC 01-20, CISA/NIST/ISA resources). Member-only sources are noted and not quoted beyond public summaries.
- No proprietary content remains; all content is generic and reusable.

## Do Not Publish (keep internal/private)
- `ai-collaboration/chat_history_*` (session transcripts and internal notes)
- `awesome-copilot/` (third-party repo content; not ours to redistribute)

## Optional/Context to Keep Internal
- Any future session transcripts or scratch pads not intended for public consumption.

## Recommended Pre-Publish Checklist
- Confirm `.gitignore` excludes the paths above.
- Verify all content is generic and reusable (no organization-specific references).
- Verify verified-reference links remain valid.
- Add a license file appropriate for open sharing (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0) if desired.
